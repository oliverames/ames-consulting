For those who make more than these threshold amounts, the payment will decrease by five dollars for every additional $100 of income.\n\nEligible families with dependents under seventeen will receive an additional $600 per dependent. Dependents seventeen or older are not eligible to receive a payment. These qualifications are based on your 2019 tax return.\n\nIf your status has changed and your household qualifies to receive a larger benefit, you can claim the additional amount you should have received on your 2020 tax return. If you receive Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability insurance, \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/stimulus-checks-for-ssi-and-ssdi-12-key-things-to-know-about-your-third-payment/\u0022\u003eCNET has some preliminary information\u003c/a\u003e about what you should expect.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan data-contrast=\u0022auto\u0022\u003e\nWHEN WILL I RECEIVE MY PAYMENT?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/22/stimulus-payments-deadline/\u0022\u003eAccording to The Washington Post\u003c/a\u003e, the United States Treasury Department is sending the latest round of stimulus payments in waves, starting the week of December 28. It is likely that Americans with direct deposit information on file with the IRS will receive their payments first. The relief bill outlines that the Treasury Department has until January 15, 2021, to send the payments. If the payments cannot be direct deposited or mailed by that date, the funds will need to be claimed when filing your 2020 tax returns.\n\nWhile the Treasury Department issues the payments, the IRS is responsible for getting them to you. Due to the start of the 2021 tax season and with many Americans still waiting for the first round of stimulus payments, it may take longer than anticipated for you to receive your payment. Calling the IRS will not expedite the process.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003ch2\u003eUpdate (january 7, 2021): i didn't receive my economic impact payment when i expected. what should i do?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\nThe IRS has announced that they deposited over 13 million stimulus payments into temporary accounts used for Americans who received their 2019 tax refunds through a tax preparer, rather than directly to personal bank accounts. The result is that many people did not receive their stimulus checks as expected.\n\n\u003ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/HRBlock/status/1346252283777003526?s=20\u0022\u003eH\u0026amp;R Block has confirmed\u003c/a\u003e that customers who took advantage of the Refund Transfer tool in 2019—used to pay the fees associated with tax preparation by covering the cost with money from your tax refund—may have had their second stimulus deposited to a temporary account rather than sent straight to them. H\u0026amp;R Block is investigating the issue and will be forwarding payments to the method you originally chose when setting up your Refund Transfer.\n\nIf you filed your 2019 taxes with TurboTax and used the Pay By Refund/Refund Processing option, \u003ca href=\u0022https://blog.turbotax.intuit.com/tax-news/why-havent-i-received-my-second-stimulus-check-48743/\u0022\u003eTurboTax now expects\u003c/a\u003e the error depositing stimulus funds into the wrong accounts to be corrected. Their statement says they have re-confirmed the correct banking information with the IRS to ensure those impacted receive their payments.\n\n\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-and-irs-begin-delivering-second-round-of-economic-impact-payments-to-millions-of-americans\u0022\u003eAccording to the IRS\u003c/a\u003e, if you receive Social Security Administration (SSA), Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), Supplementary Security Income (SSI), or Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits via a Direct Express card, your stimulus payment will be deposited on that card. The bank information displayed on \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments\u0022\u003eIRS.GOV/EIP\u003c/a\u003e will be a number associated with that card.\n\nIndividuals who see the \u0022Payment Status #2 - Not Available\u0022 message on the \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment\u0022\u003eGet My Payment tool\u003c/a\u003e will not receive the second stimulus payment automatically, even if they successfully received the first stimulus payment via direct deposit, check, or debit card. The IRS recommends that people who have not received their Economic Impact Payments file their 2020 tax return electronically and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit to get their payment and any refund as quickly as possible.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan data-contrast=\u0022auto\u0022\u003eI’M UNEMPLOYED.

It is important to note that the $600 and $2,000 checks are two separate pieces of legislation, with the $600 payments already signed into law.
