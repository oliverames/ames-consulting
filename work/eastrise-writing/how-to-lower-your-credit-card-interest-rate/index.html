Relative to other types of credit, credit cards can have high interest rates, \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.investopedia.com/average-credit-card-interest-rate-5076674\u0022\u003esome stretching above 20% annual percentage rate (APR\u003c/a\u003e\u003cu\u003e)\u003c/u\u003e It is, therefore, generally a good idea to avoid carrying a balance on your card(s) from month to month.\n\nHigh interest rates make it much harder to put a dent in your debt, especially since more of your money is going towards interest than the principal balance every time you pay your bill. It can seem hopeless if you are in this situation, but did you know that you can negotiate a lower interest rate on most credit cards? Here's how.\n\u003ch2\u003eContact the credit card company you've been with the longest\u003c/h2\u003e\nIt's best to start by calling the issuer of the credit card you have had the longest, especially if you have had a good relationship with that company. Longer, detailed credit histories mean something to credit card companies, so those you've been with for a while are much more likely to reduce your interest rate than your newer accounts.\n\u003ch2\u003eAsk for a temporary reduction\u003c/h2\u003e\nIf you don't receive a drop in your interest rate at first, you can also ask for a temporary reduction. If your credit score has recently increased, use that to your advantage.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTry again a few months later\u003c/h2\u003e\nAt the end of the day, credit card companies are run by people like you and me. Call back in a few months and ask again! It won't hurt your credit, especially if you continue to make payments. Card policies may have changed and the person on the other end might be more willing to reduce your rate, or perhaps your credit has improved enough over that short period to warrant a change.\n\u003ch2\u003eKeep an eye out for promotions on your existing cards\u003c/h2\u003e\nGiven the current economic climate, some companies that offer rewards cards, like American Express or Chase, have recently started offering drastically lower temporary rate reductions in the 3-5% APR range. Usually, these promos are only found online and require you to opt in. Keep an eye on your digital banking and credit card portals for offers like these, and don't forget to read the fine print!\n\u003ch2\u003eContact your other card issuers\u003c/h2\u003e\nStarting with the credit card accounts you've had the longest is the most likely way you'll reduce your overall interest rates since you have an existing history with them. Don't stop there though! If you have more than one card, keep going down through the list until you've contacted them all, then repeat the steps in a few months. Note that you'll see the biggest change to your personal bottom line by reducing the rate of your highest interest card or the card you carry the highest balance on.\n\nEven if you don't carry a balance on your cards, it is a good practice to regularly audit your financial tools—including your credit cards—to see if there are any opportunities to save money. Little changes here and there can really add up over time!","_long-form_text_0_tm_content":"field_6261e075a1fd3","long-form_text_0_link":"","_long-form_text_0_link":"field_5cf03b9fd9763","long-form_text_0_ada_toggle":"0","_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle":"field_5cf03bdad9764","long-form_text_0_optional_button":"","_long-form_text_0_optional_button":"field_638fb38cc1e4d","long-form_text":1,"_long-form_text":"field_6261dfe4a1fcf","row_alignment":"justify-center","_row_alignment":"field_610af955b60a5","row_background_color":"white","_row_background_color":"field_5e2f5d26eaae3","horizontal_rule":"0","_horizontal_rule":"field_5989fb5734d75","content_block_anchor":"","_content_block_anchor":"field_5984d175eaf00","block_settings":"","_block_settings":"field_62aa0ef7c0352"},"mode":"edit","id":"acf-block-66b2646178322"} /-->
