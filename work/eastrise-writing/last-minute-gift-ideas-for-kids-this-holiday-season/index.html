If you're running short on time and ideas, fear not! Here are a few last-minute gift ideas for young kids that are sure to put a smile on their faces.\u003c!\u002d\u002dmore\u002d\u002d\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eArt\u003c/h2\u003e\nMy favorite option is to give the gift of creativity with a new art set. Whether it's a set of markers, crayons, or paints, kids love getting their hands dirty and creating their own masterpieces. Not only is it a fun and engaging activity, but it also helps to foster their imagination and artistic skills. I remember when I was a kid, I loved making hats and helmets out of \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.mommypalooza.com/2012/03/wacky-hats-to-celebrate-dr-seuss.html\u0022\u003epaper grocery store bags\u003c/a\u003e, decorating them with feathers, pipe cleaners, glitter, and all kinds of other odds and ends.\n\u003ch2\u003eBooks\u003c/h2\u003e\nIf the child in your life is a fan of fantasy or science fiction, consider getting them a book from their favorite series! I am particularly a fan of the books about space by Andy Weir. \u003cem\u003eThe Martian\u003c/em\u003e is a personal favorite! There are plenty of other genres to choose from, as well as \u003ca href=\u0022https://time.com/100-best-childrens-books/\u0022\u003esome classics\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003ch2\u003eTechnology\u003c/h2\u003e\nIf the child in your life is more interested in technology, there are plenty of options for last-minute gifts in that realm as well. A new video game or app can provide endless entertainment, while a new tablet or computer can open up a world of educational and creative possibilities. One of my favorite things I ever got from my parents was a really old computer. It was made before the internet and so was a safe way to explore the basics of computing. It helped foster a lifelong love for tinkering!\n\nIn addition to the more well-known forms of technology like phones, tablets, computers, apps, and video games, there are many other types of technology that can be great gifts for young kids. For example, a new digital camera or camcorder can allow kids to explore their interests in photography and videography. A new MP3 player or portable speaker can provide endless hours of music and entertainment on the go. And a new watch or fitness tracker can introduce kids to the world of technology and help them develop healthy habits. These gifts can provide educational and creative opportunities, and help kids learn about and engage with technology in a fun and exciting way.\n\nOther great options for gifts that introduce kids to technology are robotics and building sets. These types of toys allow kids to learn about concepts like engineering, programming, and design while having fun and being creative. Many robotics and building sets are designed specifically for kids, with easy-to-follow instructions and safe, durable materials. Some popular examples include \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/mindstorms\u0022\u003eLEGO Mindstorms\u003c/a\u003e, which allows kids to build and program their own robots, and \u003ca href=\u0022https://sphero.com/collections/design-build-systems\u0022\u003elittleBits\u003c/a\u003e, which lets kids create their own electronic circuits and gadgets. These gifts can provide a unique and engaging learning experience, and help spark a lifelong interest in STEM subjects, be it science, technology, engineering, math, or all the above!\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003ch2\u003eSubscriptions\u003c/h2\u003e\nAnother idea for last-minute gifts for young kids is a subscription to a magazine or online service that aligns with their interests. For example, if the child in your life is interested in science, you could get them a subscription to a popular science magazine like \u003ca href=\u0022https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/\u0022\u003eNational Geographic Kids\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.snexplores.org/\u0022\u003eScience News for Students\u003c/a\u003e. If they love animals, a subscription to a wildlife magazine like Ranger Rick or Animal Planet Magazine could be a great option.\n\nOne of my favorites is \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.kiwico.com/\u0022\u003eKiwiCo\u003c/a\u003e, which provides monthly boxes of educational and hands-on projects. KiwiCo offers a range of different boxes designed for kids of different ages and interests, including science, art, engineering, and more. Each box comes with all the materials and instructions needed to complete several fun and engaging projects, and many of the activities are designed to encourage creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking. This type of gift not only provides hours of entertainment, but it can also help kids learn and develop new skills in a fun and interactive way. It’s an activity you can participate in, too!\n\u003ch2\u003eToys\u003c/h2\u003e\nOf course, no gift guide for young kids would be complete without mentioning the ever-popular gift of toys. Whether it's a new board game, puzzle, or building set, there are plenty of options that kids of all ages can enjoy. For younger kids, a new stuffed animal or action figure can provide hours of entertainment. These gifts not only provide enjoyment in the moment, but they can also inspire a love of reading or imaginative play that will last long after the holidays are over. Rather than purchasing online, head to your \u003ca href=\u0022https://vermontmoms.com/fantastic-toy-stores-vermont-shop-local/\u0022\u003elocal Vermont toy store\u003c/a\u003e! Clerks there love helping people find the perfect gift for the kid(s) in their life. Just be sure to check the recommended age range and safety guidelines before purchasing.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\nOverall, the key to finding the perfect last-minute gift for young kids is to think about their interests and passions. With a little bit of thought and creativity, you can find a gift that they will love and cherish for years to come. Happy holidays!\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n\u0026nbsp;","_long-form_text_0_tm_content":"field_6261e075a1fd3","long-form_text_0_link":"","_long-form_text_0_link":"field_5cf03b9fd9763","long-form_text_0_ada_toggle":"0","_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle":"field_5cf03bdad9764","long-form_text_0_optional_button":"","_long-form_text_0_optional_button":"field_638fb38cc1e4d","long-form_text":1,"_long-form_text":"field_6261dfe4a1fcf","row_alignment":"justify-center","_row_alignment":"field_610af955b60a5","row_background_color":"white","_row_background_color":"field_5e2f5d26eaae3","horizontal_rule":"0","_horizontal_rule":"field_5989fb5734d75","content_block_anchor":"","_content_block_anchor":"field_5984d175eaf00","block_settings":"","_block_settings":"field_62aa0ef7c0352"},"mode":"edit","id":"acf-block-66b2646178322"} /-->
