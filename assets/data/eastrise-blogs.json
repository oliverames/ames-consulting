If you drive in Vermont between November and March, snow tires are worth it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere's why: \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.nokiantyres.com/tips/driving-tips/when-to-put-on-winter-tires/\\u0022\\u003eall-season tires lose grip below 45°F\\u003c/a\\u003e, and Vermont's average January temperature is 19°F. Vermont gets \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://nyskiblog.com/directory/weather-data/vermont/average-snowfall/\\u0022\\u003e86 inches of snow annually\\u003c/a\\u003e—triple the national average—across 54 days of snow per year. Temperatures stay below freezing November through March. Mountain roads turn bad without warning.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow tires aren't just better in these conditions. They're a different tool entirely. This post covers why they work, what the safety data shows, what they cost, and when to install them.\\r\\n\\u003ch2 id=\\u0022why-snow-tires-work-better-in-vermonts-cold\\u0022\\u003eWhy do snow tires work better in cold weather?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nSnow tires use a different rubber compound. If you watch any form of motor racing, you'll know that tire compound matters a lot. Snow tires have \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.continental-tires.com/products/b2c/tire-knowledge/summer-or-winter-tires/\\u0022\\u003emore natural rubber and silica\\u003c/a\\u003e. That keeps them flexible when it's cold. If you were to run a set of snow tires all year, they would degrade much faster in warmer temperatures as a result. All-season tires use harder rubber that stiffens up below 45°F because they've been optimized to last in mild climates. Hard rubber doesn't grip. That's it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow tires also have thousands of tiny cuts in them called \\u0022sipes.\\u0022 These create edges that bite into ice and push water away from the tire. All-season tires have fewer sipes and shallower grooves.\\r\\n\\r\\nReal winter tires have a three-peak mountain snowflake symbol on the sidewall. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/all-season-vs-winter-tires-differences\\u0022\\u003eThat symbol means the tire passed industry testing\\u003c/a\\u003e for severe snow service. It's more rigorous than the M+S (mud and snow) marking you see on most all-season tires.\\r\\n\\u003ch2 id=\\u0022stopping-distance-tests-show-30-feet-of-difference\\u0022\\u003eHow much more effective are snow tires at stopping?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tests/testDisplay.jsp?ttid=103\\u0022\\u003eTire Rack tested tires on packed snow at 30 mph\\u003c/a\\u003e. Winter tires stopped in 59 feet. All-season tires needed 89 feet. That's 30 feet longer, about two car lengths.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/features/tire-test-all-season-vs-snow-vs-summer.html\\u0022\\u003eEdmunds tested at 40 mph on snow\\u003c/a\\u003e. Winter tires stopped in 156 feet. All-season tires stopped in 184 feet.

Winter tires stopped in 34 feet, but all-season tires needed 57 feet to do the same job. That is 67% longer at barely more than a jogging pace!\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer Reports found winter tires consistently \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/time-for-that-annual-debate-winter-tires-or-all-seasons/article36860134/\\u0022\\u003estopped 6 feet shorter on ice\\u003c/a\\u003e and needed 22 feet less distance to accelerate from 5 to 20 mph on packed snow.\\r\\n\\u003ch2 id=\\u0022the-safety-data-from-mandatory-winter-tire-regions\\u0022\\u003eWhat's the safety data from mandatory winter tire regions?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nWhile Vermont doesn't require winter tires for passenger vehicles, our closest neighbor, Quebec, does require them from \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.quebec.ca/en/transports/traffic-road-safety/winter-road-safety/requirements-for-winter-tires\\u0022\\u003eDecember 1 through March 15\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Quebec made winter tires mandatory in 2008, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.tires-easy.com/blog/winter-tires/\\u0022\\u003e574 fewer people were injured in winter collisions\\u003c/a\\u003e in the first two years. Deaths and serious injuries dropped 3%. Annual crashes have been cut in half since the law took effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany saw similar results. Before mandatory winter tires in 2005, Germany logged 12,539 collisions with injuries in winter conditions. By 2008, after the requirement, that \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://united.legal/EN/services/motor-vehicle-accidents/snow-tires\\u0022\\u003enumber dropped to 6,003.\\u003c/a\\u003e That is a 52% reduction!\\r\\n\\r\\nA Swedish study found studded tires showed a \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22269484/\\u0022\\u003e42% reduction in fatal crashes\\u003c/a\\u003e on ice and snow-covered roads compared to non-studded winter tires. 64% of fatal crashes on icy roads involved loss of control.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://tracanada.ca/tire-reports/winter-tire-report-2020/\\u0022\\u003e81% of winter tire owners in Canada\\u003c/a\\u003e believe their winter tires saved them from a hazardous driving situation—either loss of control or a collision.\\r\\n\\u003ch2 id=\\u0022what-it-costs\\u0022\\u003eWhat do snow tires cost?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nA set of four winter tires for a midsize car runs \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://cansumer.ca/winter-tires-cost/\\u0022\\u003e$800 to $1,500\\u003c/a\\u003e. Basic winter tires for smaller vehicles cost $80 to $125 per tire. Performance winter tires run $100 to $500 per tire depending on your vehicle. There's a lot of choice in the market!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.torquenews.com/14093/best-wintersnow-tires-rated-and-recommended-consumer-reports\\u0022\\u003eConsumer Reports' top-rated winter tire\\u003c/a\\u003e for 2024, the Bridgestone Blizzak WS90, costs $131 per tire in standard sizes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost folks who buy snow tires mount them on their existing wheels and pay a shop \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://cansumer.ca/winter-tires-cost/\\u0022\\u003e$60 to $80 twice a year\\u003c/a\\u003e to swap them. However, some Vermonters choose to buy a second set of steel rims for $200 to $360, have the winter tires mounted once, and swap the wheels themselves each season.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you buy a second set of wheels, you'll need \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://tractionlife.com/winter-tire-cost-expectations-and-options/\\u0022\\u003etire pressure monitoring sensors\\u003c/a\\u003e for $200 to $500 total. Federal law requires them on all vehicles made since 2008. One-time cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver five years: $1,250 to $2,800 total depending on which route you take. That's $250 to $560 per year on average.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor most people, that's still a big chunk of change, but there's something we haven't talked about yet: while you're driving on winter tires for five months each year, your all-season tires aren't wearing down. That extends their life by roughly 8,500 kilometers annually. You're actually not doubling your tire costs, you're spreading wear across two sets.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinter tires typically last five to six seasons, though my heavy electric vehicle turns that into two to three seasons. Don't drive them in summer though, that soft compound wears out fast on hot pavement!\\r\\n\\u003ch2 id=\\u0022when-to-install-them\\u0022\\u003eWhen should you install snow tires?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nSwitch to winter tires when temperatures consistently stay \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.nokiantyres.com/tips/driving-tips/when-to-put-on-winter-tires/\\u0022\\u003ebelow 45°F\\u003c/a\\u003e. Switch back when they consistently stay above 45°F. That's the temperature where all-season rubber hardens. Remember, it isn't all about the tread on the tire but the tire compound itself! Snow or not, winter tires will perform better below 45°F.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Vermont, that's typically late October or early November through late March or early April. Ground temperatures run colder than air temperatures. Morning temperatures drop well below afternoon highs. Don't wait too long! I always do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis may seem like common knowledge, but the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://vsp.vermont.gov/trafficsafety/winter\\u0022\\u003eVermont State Police recommend\\u003c/a\\u003e putting winter tires on all four wheels. Mixing tire types creates unpredictable handling, especially in corners. All four wheels need the same grip!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile you are at it, check your tread depth. A good shop will do this for you every time you bring your vehicle in for service. The legal minimum is 2/32 of an inch, but winter tires should be replaced at \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.wishtv.com/news/business/winter-tires-best-2024/\\u0022\\u003e4/32 or less\\u003c/a\\u003e. If you don't have a tire depth gauge at home, use the penny test! Simply insert a penny into the tread of the tire. If you can see all of Lincoln's head, get new tires.\\r\\n\\u003ch2 id=\\u0022vermont-doesnt-require-them\\u0022\\u003eDoes Vermont require winter tires?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nVermont has \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://dmv.vermont.gov/enforcement-and-safety/laws/chain-up-law\\u0022\\u003eno winter tire mandate\\u003c/a\\u003e for passenger vehicles, though studded tires are legal year-round. The state requires chains for commercial vehicles over 26,000 pounds on Route 9 during bad weather, but that's it. Insurance companies don't offer winter tire discounts either, unlike in Ontario where insurers give 2% to 5% off premiums if you install winter tires.\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan Pszczolkowski, Consumer Reports' tire program manager, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.wishtv.com/news/business/winter-tires-best-2024/\\u0022\\u003eput it this way\\u003c/a\\u003e: \\u0022If you have a job where you need to be at work no matter what and you do encounter winter conditions, it might be a good investment.\\u0022\\r\\n\\r\\nHere's how I see it. Snow tires aren't an investment. They're basic equipment. Maybe you'll need to run to the hospital in the worst weather all year. You can't control when black ice forms or when the next snowstorm hits.  You can control whether your tires grip the road when it matters.\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-68fbc93467334\"} /-->",

Thanks for joining us today for EastRise Credit Union's fraud overview with a specialist from our fraud department. If anyone has any questions today during our session, please look at the bottom of the screen where there's a Q\\u0026amp;A, and you can put your question there and we'll happily answer it. Either throughout this presentation, but definitely we'll have time at the end to answer. I'm so grateful our speaker is here today. Our speaker is someone who brings experience in this space, so can answer questions that you might have. And this is really your first step towards fighting fraud, is to be educated. So I'm glad that folks are joining us and I'm going to hand the mic over to our speaker. Thanks so much for being here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eEastRise Fraud Expert:\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nGood afternoon, everybody. I'm here delivering a message on behalf of the fraud department at EastRise Credit Union. So the gist of today, we're going to go over a handful of things, talk about what fraud might look like, why you should care about it, what you should do if you think that you've come across it, that kind of thing. Just sort of lay the framework, lay the foundation for being able to keep an eye out for yourself and for your family, friends, neighbors, that kind of thing. So the three key questions for today, what is fraud? Why should I care about it? And then what can I do to keep myself safe, keep my money safe, and keep the people I care about safe?\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what is fraud? I think it's a word that gets tossed around a lot. It's one that I think a lot of people are obviously familiar with to some degree. You wouldn't have signed up to watch something like this if you weren't at least peripherally aware that fraud is a thing. But I think that the actual definition can get a little bit lost in the weeds for some folks. So at the end of the day, when you boil it down to its simplest definition, fraud is misrepresentation for financial gain. It's that simple. If you distill it down, that is the one thing in common with every single thing that we apply the word fraud to.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that can range, there's all different kinds of ways that that can look. I mean the classic example, I think that a lot of people would have it come to mind when they think about fraud or might use as a prompt, is Bernie Madoff. Enormous Ponzi scheme. This massive, massive operation in which he's taking in all of this money from investors, and then not actually generating a profit or a return on it, and only paying out just enough to have people think, \\u0022Oh wow, this is really something. This is really an incredible investment opportunity. I need to give this guy my money.\\u0022 And meanwhile, he's blowing all of it on this extravagant lifestyle and it's all a sham. He's misrepresented this investment opportunity for his own financial gain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt could also be, rather than misrepresenting what you're doing, it could be misrepresenting who you are. Anna Delvey/Sorokin, if you've watched the Netflix documentary, Inventing Anna. This is somebody who pretended to be someone who she was not, who was far more wealthy, and connected, and impressive than she actually was. And was able to use this character that she had created for her own financial gain, being able to take out loans or get people to give her money. And she just sort of posed as this well-off socialite for a long enough time that she was able to extract a lot of money from folks. So lying about who you are, or the purpose of funds, or the source of funds, all of these things can be different ways that somebody commits fraud.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of the purpose or the source of funds, Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos, this golden egg in Silicon Valley in the venture capitalist world, where this woman said, \\u0022I have this incredible product and it's going to do all of these amazing things. And we'll be able to tell so much about you, and your health, and your health history, and your health future from this very simple blood sample.\\u0022 And ultimately, she was completely making the whole thing up but was able to get a ton of money from folks in pursuit of this alleged idea. Could also be a lot more simple than that, it could be things like check fraud, just lying about altering a check, forging a signature. It could be things that are happening at a much smaller scale than these massive headline grabbing schemes. And in the case of somebody like Frank Abagnale, a lot of the fraud that he committed was for informational gain that can later be used for financial gain.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstanding enough about the way that a system worked, understanding enough about the ins and outs of an industry, or business, or something like that. And then being able to apply that information later in order to realize that financial gain instead of just the informational gain. So we've gone over some broad concepts of what fraud schemes might look like or what the broader definition of fraud is, but there's a lot of silos that these can get categorized into that are some of the schemes that we see more often and that you might be threatened with more often. And so I'm curious to see what different schemes people are particularly familiar with, considering that there is a pretty broad range that are out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we'll go through the slides. Obviously, this will be an opportunity for you to kind of see if you go, \\u0022Oh, I'm familiar with one of these.\\u0022 But once I start actually describing it in detail, how close was your initial estimate in terms of what we're actually talking about here? So first things first, we've got phishing, vishing, smishing. These are different variants of the same concept. Phishing is one that people are, generally speaking, pretty familiar with. Phishing is some kind of attempt to get the recipient of the phishing attempt to click a link or to take some kind of action. Phishing is usually used to refer to doing this through email.\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting some kind of spam email that's trying to get you to open an attachment or click on a link. It might be tempting you with some kind of lottery prize or any number of things. But the whole crux of the thing is to try to get you to click a link, take an action, download an attachment, whatever it might be that then gives the fraudster some kind of access to something. So it could be things like you get an email from \\u0022Microsoft\\u0022 and it's like, \\u0022Oh, your Microsoft account is compromised and we need you to click this link, and go to this website, and verify your password.\\u0022 And so you click that link, and it takes you to a website, and you type in your password.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that link, of course, did not take you to Microsoft's website. Microsoft doesn't actually really know what your password is. And so what you've done is you've gone to the fraudster's website, you've typed in your password, and they go, \\u0022Great, that's the password for this email or for the Microsoft account associated with this email. I can now log into that account and use it for nefarious means.\\u0022 Whatever those might be. So phishing is a really common one, but it doesn't necessarily have to be limited to email, it could be any number of things, smishing, SMS or text. You get a spam text that is trying to get you to go to some kind of link, maybe it's something that's pretending to be USPS and it's, \\u0022Your package couldn't be delivered. Please click this link to verify your contact information.\\u0022 It could be that you are going to be the recipient of some kind of incredible prize if you click on this link, and go to this website, and enter your credit card info.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt could be any number of things, but it still has that core component of trying to get you to click on something, or to download something, or to engage with this in some way that gives the fraudsters access. Vishing, same concept, we're just talking about it now within the context of a phone call, where the fraudster might be on the other end of the line telling you to do something on your computer, like for example, Microsoft tech support calling you to try to get you to do some stuff on your computer or download a program that gives them access. Or the phone call telling you that you've won a prize and please visit this website and enter your information. You get the idea. It's just slightly different terminology to refer to different mediums through which this can happen. But the one key thing remaining the same across all of them is getting you to do something by tempting you, or threatening you, or whatever it might be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one thing I do want to add to this is there is such a thing as spear phishing, which is when one of these things, the fraudster goes about it in a much more targeted manner. So that's something like we often see this with an executive or some kind of public figure. Somebody that there's a little bit more information available out on the web, someone that a fraudster could kind of piece together something that seems like a little bit more legitimate than just your random, poorly spelled, semi-nonsense phishing attempt that you sometimes get. Instead, it might be somebody pitching themselves as some kind of potential investor in whatever project this public figure is involved in, or could be disguising as some kind of invoice and they want you to download the invoice, so that the malware embedded in the attachment can take hold of your computer.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoesn't necessarily have to be somebody that's famous or well-known, it's just spear phishing is, instead of sending this blast email out to tens of thousands of people, it's narrowing it down to a single individual to try to make it seem more legitimate. It's a little more effort on the part of the fraudster, but maybe there's more chance of a payoff. Next one is identity theft. I think if there's anything that folks are going to be aware of in terms of a fraud scheme that they've probably heard of before, it's probably identity theft. It's somewhat self-explanatory in terms of, it is when a fraudster steals someone else's identity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, while that is relatively self-explanatory in terms of what the actual phrase means, what does that actually gain you as a fraudster? What does this actually do if I am... If I'm stealing somebody's identity, what am I actually intending to do with that? And what we usually see is with a stolen identity, with somebody's name, social security number, date of birth, address, all that kind of stuff, well, think about in your own life, when do you use that kind of information? You might use it to apply for a loan, like a credit card, for example. You might use it to register for some kind of service. You might use it to apply for a car loan, a mortgage even.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnytime that you would use that stuff, somebody that's stolen your identity could use that stuff. And so usually, it is to apply for a loan, it's to open up credit cards in your name, rack up colossal bills, and then, \\u0022Oh look, I don't have to suffer the consequences of this because it's not my identity. I just have this credit card in so-and-so's name and I can use it to buy whatever I want, and never pay for it, and they're the ones that suffer the consequences.\\u0022 And so yeah, it's posing as somebody else for financial gain because you don't have to deal with any of the fallout in being wildly irresponsible and reckless with that identity. So next, and this can seem similar because imposter, we think about somebody posing as somebody else, pretending to be somebody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this isn't actually identity theft, this is its own separate category. And an imposter scam is when the fraudster poses as some kind of legitimate entity that you are probably pretty familiar with. That could be posing as the IRS, that could be posing as FEMA, for example. One of the things that we've seen for this kind of thing is in the wake of the flood that we've had here in Vermont this past summer and the summer before, or look to even more recent events down in North Carolina, down in Florida, that kind of thing. We've seen scam attempts where a fraudster poses as, say, FEMA and says, \\u0022Hey, we are willing to provide you financial relief because you're in this affected area, and so please fill out all this information. We need to verify that you are who you say you are, so give us your social security number, give us your address, give us your date of birth, give us your bank account information, so that we can send you some funds that you can use to keep things going, keep your life on track in the wake of this disaster.\\u0022\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd obviously, they then are able to take that information and maybe make fake checks with all of the right information, or steal your identity because you gave them your social security number, that kind of thing. Imposter scams are, generally speaking, revolving around, you've won a prize of some kind. That might be something like the FEMA example of like, \\u0022Hey, there's funds available for you, please apply so that you can get them.\\u0022 That might be something like a lottery like, \\u0022Congratulations, you've won some kind of sweepstakes and so please send us the taxes that you need to pay on this million dollar prize and then we'll release the funds and send them to you.\\u0022\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can take any number of forms, but yeah, generally it's posing as some kind of legitimate entity with some sort of great temptation, it's usually having won a prize. There are instances of this as well that we see that are some kind of, rather than a prize it's kind of the flip side of it and it's like the threat of some kind of great consequence. I mentioned the IRS being something that we'll see for imposter scams a lot of the time, and that is usually something along the lines of, \\u0022We've determined that you haven't paid sufficient taxes in the last couple of years and we're going to audit you super heavily unless you send us the $5,000 that you owe in back taxes.\\u0022 Or something like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ins and outs and the little details are less important than the either temptation of great prize or fear of great consequence being really common in imposter scams. Computer compromise, that's another one that I think probably a lot of people are relatively familiar with. It's just fraudsters gaining access to your computer. And when I say computer, I think it's fair to say that I'm speaking more broadly to smart electronic devices. I'm including cell phones in this, iPhone, Android, your tablet, whatever it might be. The purpose and the concept is the same of, our whole life revolves around these little electronic bricks, whether it's your phone, whether it's your PC, doesn't really matter. And you've probably got all kinds of passwords stored on there, and you've probably got digital banking that you can access through there. Or maybe you've got your credit card information stored in your smartphone, so that you can check out from your favorite websites more easily, things like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nFraudsters find all of that stuff extremely appealing, and so of course, they're going to try to get into your computer somehow in order to gain access to all of the stuff that you've got waiting in there. And this can be accomplished in a number of different ways. This could be things like phishing, like we talked about earlier. It could be things like vishing or social engineering, where they call you and then they walk you through the steps to install some kind of program on your computer. Because they've convinced you that they're a legitimate tech support and that you need their help to get rid of some nasty stuff on your computer or to fix whatever's wrong with it. It could be things like a hacked website, where instead of putting your credit card information into Amazon.com, you're putting it into Ammazon.com, but it's spelled with two M's and it's actually a completely bogus storefront, and now the fraudster has your credit card information.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr it could be that you're trying to download a movie or something for free, and the website is super shady, and instead of downloading the movie, you download the movie and also some malware that now has given that fraudster access to your computer. One of the things that we see more commonly for this type of fraud is... Or I shouldn't say more commonly, what I should say is one of the more common really devastating versions of this because when we do see it, it's often really nasty, is ransomware. The idea with ransomware is that the fraudster, after gaining access to your computer with some kind of program, that program then encrypts your hard drive, it encrypts all of the data that you have stored on your device. And when that data is encrypted, it can only be accessed through the key, the decryption key, which of course you don't have, the fraudster has.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so they're essentially holding your information hostage. They're saying, \\u0022I have encrypted all your stuff and the only way that you're going to be able to get all your information back, all your pictures, all your videos, all your programs, whatever, is if you send me $500 in gift cards from your local grocery store, you go in and buy all these Visa gift cards.\\u0022 Or maybe they want you to send them some kind of cryptocurrency or whatever method of choice they prefer. But the fact of the matter is that, yeah, this is a huge problem, because yeah, a lot of the time encryption these days is really, really good and it's not like a password that you can just guess, it's like a 64 or 128 character long thing that's complete gibberish. And yeah, the fraudster is the only one that's got it and so a lot of people end up giving them the money, but then does the fraudster actually give them that information back? Maybe. Maybe not.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of the time we see that they don't. And so it's a really nasty one because going through the recovery process to try to get that data can be really challenging, and a lot of the time the fraudster kind of strings along the victim and says, \\u0022You got to give me this money. You got to give me that money. That wasn't enough. I actually want you to do this other thing instead.\\u0022 And because they have this leverage over this person by having their information held hostage, they're able to use the victim as a pawn or to try to extract even more money than they initially were asking for, that kind of thing. So ransomware is a really nasty one. Obviously, anything computer related can get pretty ugly. But yeah, we see it as a vehicle for other types of fraud, we see it as a version of fraud in and of itself. It covers all kinds of bases.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the slightly less technological side of the spectrum, we have check scams. These have been around since the day the check was invented. They have been through all kinds of iterations in that time, especially with the advent of things like Photoshop and other editing software, they've taken on a whole new life. Mobile deposit has probably also helped with folks' ability to try to facilitate check scams. So yeah, we still see these all the time. Checks are pretty easily altered. It's physical media. I can go in there with a pen and some Wite-Out and do some pretty decent damage. And so we see these as a vehicle for fraud all the time, or we see them as fraud in their own right. Some of the more common things that we see are fraudsters paying for some kind of good or service with an altered check.\\r\\n\\r\\nI alluded to this earlier when we talked about identity theft and a fraudster crafting a check based on the information that you've willingly given them because you thought they were somebody else, because now they can just cash these checks all over the place, take out the money, and that money is not something that they are going to be held liable for, it's going to be whoever's name and information is on the check. We also see a lot of instances in which fraudsters overpay for something. For example, it might be purchasing something off of Craigslist, for example, where the fraudster comes and they pay, let's say you list a kayak for 400 bucks, and then the fraudster comes and they write you a check for 800. And then shortly thereafter they're like, \\u0022Ah, you know what? Actually, we agreed on 400. I wrote you this $800 check. Can you just send me the $400 back please?\\u0022\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd you not knowing any better go, \\u0022Yeah, sure, no problem.\\u0022 And you send them the 400 bucks. And then fast-forward a couple of days and their $800 check bounces because checks take a couple of days to process when you talk about the fact that they've got to go through the Fed and we've got to communicate with the other financial institution. Without getting into the weeds of how checks work, it takes a few days for them to process, and that's just enough time for a fraudster to pay for something, ask for some of the money back, so that you pay them, and then abscond with both the money and whatever thing it is that they bought with that check. So now you're out 400 bucks and your kayak. So we see that one pretty often. Less so for something like Craigslist, we usually don't see it with something in person, but we see this as something that happens online all the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne I dealt with recently, for example, was a member was contacted on Instagram, via Instagram DMs, direct messages, and somebody said, \\u0022Hey, I'm an artist and there's this picture on your profile that I love and I want to paint it. Do I have your permission to do so? I will pay you a commission because I'm using this thing that is yours as the basis for my art.\\u0022 And of course, the person who had initially posted this image, our member, was super flattered and they were like, \\u0022Yeah, absolutely. That's fantastic.\\u0022 Fraudster goes, \\u0022Great, here's 2,500 bucks.\\u0022 And it's a check. And then they go and they do that thing I just talked about with the Craigslist scam of like, \\u0022Oh, I'm so sorry. Actually, the rate is supposed to be 2,000. Can you Venmo me back the 500 bucks that I overpaid?\\u0022\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this person not knowing any better went, \\u0022Yep, no problem.\\u0022 Sent them the 500 bucks. And then fast-forward a couple of days, the check bounces, and this person is now out $500. And of course, there was no artist, there was no art, this was entirely just a ruse to get this person to send money. The artist and commission angle being one that will catch you super off guard and is really flattering, you feel good, of course you want to participate in this thing, it's all very exciting. And so you don't take the time to think about it and go, \\u0022Why would they have to pay me commission? They could just use this as inspiration, they don't need to pay me commission. They could have totally gotten away with this and never told me about it. And why are they paying via check? And why am I getting this check that's ostensibly from an artist, and it's like some random landscaping company in another state or whatever?\\u0022 Whoever's check it is that they altered to be able to send this stuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so that actually touches on something that is common in check scams, but is common in really any type of scam, and that is to create a sense of urgency. The whole premise is to set things up in such a way where the potential victim doesn't have a huge amount of time to think about things, to take a step back and go, \\u0022What is happening? Does this actually make sense? Is this something real? Does everything actually add up here?\\u0022 Because most of the time if you take that step back, and you think about what's going on, and you actually ask those questions of yourself, you'll find out that the story falls apart pretty fast. This doesn't actually make a lot of sense. They're telling me I won this lottery and that I need to pay the taxes on the amount that I won, so that they can release the funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, why wouldn't the taxes just come out of the funds that I won? Why do they want me to send them money? Things like that. You start to ask some questions and realize that the story doesn't actually make any sense, they're just trying to get me to act quickly, so that I don't have an opportunity to think about this stuff. Or to throw me off my game, so I don't have an opportunity to think about this stuff. So whether it's through some kind of great temptation or great threat, there's a common thread of creating a sense of urgency. The next type that I think is worth talking about, some argue that this is kind of a subset of the imposter scams, where the fraudster's pretending to be someone or something. In this case, they're obviously pretending to be someone. But I think that it's one that warrants its own separate set of discussion, which is the relationship scam.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's basically the fraudster posing as somebody that they are not and playing a character and playing a role. And ultimately, the intent is to get the potential victim to trust, and in the fraudsters best case scenario, fall in love with this character. The whole idea here is you build up this relationship, you earn trust, you get to a point where the victim trusts the fraudster. They think they know this person. They're maybe in love with this person. They think that there's this really deep connection that they have. And that's when the fraudster starts to ask for money. That's when the fraudster is like, \\u0022Oh, well I...\\u0022 This usually happens online. It's usually, you set up a profile on a dating website, or app, or whatever, and so this person is like, \\u0022Oh, well, I'm so far away, but I feel like you're my soulmate. And yes, of course I want to come and see you and be with you, I just, there's no way I can afford the plane ticket. Can you send me the money to do that?\\u0022\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so of course, this person wanting to meet the love of their life, or who they think the love of their life is, they send the money willingly. It could be that the fraudster is actually, \\u0022There's this medical event and my mom is so sick and I don't know how I'm going to be able to afford this.\\u0022 And of course, you want to help this person that you have these strong feelings for, so you send the money. The way that they start to try to extract money from the victim can take practically infinite forms. There's all kinds of different ways that this can take place, but the whole idea is that they build up trust with the victim to the point that they feel like, \\u0022Yeah, I can probably start extracting some value out of this person.\\u0022 And then they just start asking for money again, and again, and again, and they just run this victim for all that they're worth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so we have seen a lot of instances of this at the credit union, or you ask somebody from the fraud department at really any financial institution and they will agree this is really common. I think it got particularly common in the wake of the pandemic. There was a lot less face-to-face interaction. A lot of people were a lot more lonely than they had been before. I think also when you combine that with the fact that online dating, and dating apps, and that kind of thing. Online connections of this type have gotten a lot more common in the last five, 10, 15 years. The end result is that, yeah, this is a seriously common and seriously damaging type of fraud. We see it, I think, the most with the elderly. They are, I think, a little less familiar with what \\u0022catfishing\\u0022 might look like. Catfishing being a term that a lot of millennials or Gen Z use to talk about an online profile that is entirely fake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photos are pulled from some random models Instagram, and all of the information is totally bogus, and it's somebody completely different running this stuff from behind the scenes. And so this is catfishing to the nth degree, where you have somebody not only doing this and presenting themselves as someone that they're not, who seems super interesting, and appealing, and attractive, and a great partner, but then they use that for pretty nefarious means and try to get a lot of money out of folks. While it's technically, I suppose, just a kind of imposter scam, it's growing rapidly enough and is devastating enough when it happens that it's really worth highlighting on its own.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the last example I want to talk about for some of the more common scam archetypes that we see is that of the cryptocurrency scam. This is another one that has proliferated like wildfire in the last couple of years because cryptocurrency has proliferated like wildfire in the past couple of years. Anytime some kind of new technology comes out, surprise, surprise, somebody's going to try to use it to scam someone else. We've seen that with AI, we've seen that with dating apps, that kind of thing, like I mentioned on the last slide. And we're seeing it here with cryptocurrency. I think this one preys primarily on the concept of FOMO, or fear of missing out. FOMO being the acronym. Anybody that's watched the news or paid attention to cryptocurrency at all has seen that, yeah, there have been tremendous swings in value, and truly astounding potential for profit. There are coins and cryptocurrencies that have gone from 5 cents per unit to $40,000 per unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's unbelievable to see. And so there's a lot of people that look at that, compared to your traditional investment vehicles of stocks and bonds, and they're like, \\u0022Holy smokes, I've got to get involved in that. This is such an enormous opportunity and I want to be a part of it.\\u0022 And so there's a lot of scammers that know that there's a lot of people that feel that way, and so they advertise these insane returns, insane profits. I had a case that's been going on for the past couple of months in which somebody was pitched a cryptocurrency investment opportunity. And when I talked to this person about the investment, because they wanted to wire all these funds to this destination that didn't really look like a legitimate investment opportunity, when I talked to them about it, they said, \\u0022Well, I got pitched this investment opportunity by somebody that I met online, and what they've told me is that this trading firm for cryptocurrency has found a way to shield me from any downturns in the market, so the value can only go up.\\u0022\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd sure, that sounds great. Wouldn't that be lovely if that were a way that the world worked, where your investment was going to grow like crazy and you were completely free of any and all risk? I can understand why this person was so tempted by that. Now, of course, if you start to actually think about it, you go, \\u0022Well, that doesn't make any sense.\\u0022 There's no way to do that. If there was, everyone would do it. That's just not how investment works. But with it being cryptocurrency, with it being this new, and confusing, and complicated thing that all anybody really knows about it, for the most part, unless you're really kind of into the weeds on it, all anybody really knows is, yeah, it's really volatile and there are some people making a ton of money off of it. And that's all she knew and she went, \\u0022Well, this seems like a way to really keep myself safe while still reaping the benefits.\\u0022\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so she wanted to send all of this money to what was clearly a scam. And so yeah, it's preying on that fear of missing out, on the massive returns that some people have been able to find in this market. And it preys on the fact that crypto is really confusing and it's really complicated. The inner workings of how this stuff operates aren't something that a lot of people are particularly versed in. And from the perspective of the scammer, it's really hard to track/convict somebody for crypto fraud. Obviously, there have been some pretty high profile exceptions to this, like Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX. If you've seen any of the stories about that in the news, it's a guy that ran a giant trading platform that, ultimately, has now been arrested for an unbelievable number of counts of fraud, and wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit fraud, and all sorts of nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the whole nature of the platform of cryptocurrency is that it's anonymized. Everybody's got their little wallet, which is like your bank account, and you can see what activity happens with each wallet, but there's no names affiliated with any of those. And so it's really hard to tell who is associated with this wallet that's conducting this scam. It could be somebody that's international. It could be multiple people. It could be someone legitimate whose wallet was compromised by some kind of hacker. Because it's not like the banking industry where like, okay, if there's a bank account that's involved in fraud, there's a name associated with that account, we can start to dig in and figure out who is involved in this and what's going on. You don't get that same kind of insight with cryptocurrency, and so it's really a really tempting vehicle for fraudsters when they're trying to commit some kind of scam because it helps keep their identity safe and they're able to perpetrate that much more fraud.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so I think the takeaway that I talk to a lot of folks about when it comes to cryptocurrency fraud or crazy investment schemes and that kind of stuff, and this is true for all fraud, but it's particularly true here. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. I think that's the message that a lot of these folks are like, \\u0022This is unbelievable. How can they protect me from all of the downsides of the investment? It seems too good to be true.\\u0022 Well, it's because they can't protect you from all the downsides of your investment and it is too good to be true.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo as a rule of thumb for really any kind of situation like this, but particularly cryptocurrency, yeah, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. So transitioning out of the spiel of, here's all the different types of schemes, and scams, and fraud, and financial crime, and et cetera, we get to the next part which is, okay, that's all well and good. I know what this stuff is now, but why should I care? I've never been scammed. I'm too clever for that. And most people have not fallen victim to some kind of scam. If most people were falling victim to some kind of scam, there'd be a lot more people at the credit union doing the kind of job that I do. And so yeah, fortunately, most people and their money are safe, but I think that it's important to highlight a couple of things when it comes to the sales pitch of why this stuff matters and why it's important.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst things first, fraud's just getting a lot more common. I alluded to earlier, every time we see a new technology, somebody somewhere is going to try to use it to scam someone else, and there's been a lot of those lately. There's been cryptocurrency, like I just talked about. We also talked about that with dating apps and that sort of thing. I mentioned AI. We are seeing AI being used for scams now. Things like these deep fakes that you can do where AI is able to take a bunch of samples of somebody's voice and then regurgitate what really, in a lot of cases, sounds shockingly similar to the person pretending that this AI is. We've seen that used on phone calls to try to get access to somebody's account. We can see that with video deep fakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's any number of different things that are getting more and more common that make it more and more possible to perpetrate fraud. And in some cases, make it that much harder to actually detect and react to. I think this was worsened by the pandemic. I think that there's a few reasons for that. I think in some cases, like the romance scams, people were more isolated, people were more lonely, they were more desperate for human connection, and a lot of fraudsters preyed on that. I also think that the world got a lot more online and a lot more people were exposed to scams, and schemes, and fraud that may not have encountered that in the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that there's probably some degree of desperate times calling for desperate measures, where people lost their job, or the economy of entire nations was completely down the tubes and people resorted to trying to scam people online because it was the only way that they could think of or the only way that they had available to them to try to make ends meet. Now, of course, I'm not excusing the fact that they were committing crime and hurting other people to do that. But what I am saying is that it became a lot more common during that time, and I really have not seen much of a decrease even as the restrictions have loosened and things are back to \\u0022normal\\u0022 whatever normal is these days. So it's getting a lot more common and it's something that everybody needs to be that much more aware of.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also think that there's a lot of folks that maybe feel like they don't need to care because the only people that they know that get scammed by this stuff are older and they're like, \\u0022Well, I'm young, and I'm with it, and I understand the internet, and I know how to see this stuff coming a mile away, and I don't need to worry about it.\\u0022 And the data really doesn't back that up, unfortunately. Everybody is at risk, it just comes down to what in particular you are at risk for. This data is a couple years old at this point, but is essentially breaking down what percentage of people in various demographics have reported a loss from fraud and the amount of that loss by age. And this is, I am completely blanking on the name of the non-profit that provided this information. I wish I remembered it so I could tell you all about it because they're a fantastic resource. Hopefully, that'll come to me by the end of the presentation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the meantime, just looking at the chart, there's a couple of key takeaways. Number one, there's a shockingly high percentage of folks reporting a loss in various demographics, and we actually see it be a little bit higher at younger ages than we do at older ages. Now, I personally am of the opinion that the reason it's lower at older ages is because the reporting for this data was done online, and there's some folks at those older ages that are maybe a little bit less inclined to report it or don't know that that reporting option is available, which sort of deflates the number that actually report a loss. And so my guess is that the yellow golden line here is actually probably a lot closer to level at around that high 50s, low 60% mark than maybe the data would suggest. But the fact of the matter remains that, boy, that is a lot more people than you might think are actually falling victim to this stuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other thing that's worth highlighting is the amount lost by different demographics. In particular, I want to highlight the 20 to 29 age group being a bit of a spike and a bit of a higher amount. I think in my experience, and granted this is an anecdotal explanation for the data, but in my experience, this is right around the age that a lot of folks achieve some degree of financial independence or have a lack of parental oversight for the first time. And so they've got their money, they're in the world, they don't know how the world works quite as well as somebody that's been in it for a couple more decades, and they're a little more liable to make a pretty nasty mistake than some of the older age ranges might be.\\r\\n\\r\\nObviously, there's not a quiz at the end, the numbers themselves aren't super crucial here. I think the key takeaway though is that there's a lot more people that are a lot more likely to be victims than we maybe think there might be because we all kind of fall victim to that like, \\u0022Oh, it's only the elderly that fall for scams, and I'm young, and I'm smart, and I'm not going to be a victim.\\u0022 The data doesn't really back it up. And so the thing I want to talk about is blind spots that each age range starts to fall victim to.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause that's ultimately what it comes down to, is that you might, as a 30 something, go, \\u0022Well, yeah, of course I'm not going to fall for this cryptocurrency scam because I'm super into crypto and I know how it works. And so when I see these scam pitches for investment, I can spot them a mile away and I don't need to worry about it.\\u0022 Great, that's not a blind spot for you, that might be a blind spot for somebody else. But there are other things that your demographic, your generation could potentially be falling victim to. And so the thing that we see for the younger generations that's the biggest blind spot for them is checks. Because there's a lot of folks these days in the 18, 25, early 30s, that kind of thing, that don't use checks regularly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was talking to a friend about check scams and how to spot this kind of stuff, and they told me the only checks that they have ever interacted with were checks from extended family for a birthday, graduation, that kind of thing. And then the only checks that they've ever written were their monthly rent check to their landlord, and that's it. They don't use a check when they go to a store. They don't use a check to pay their utility bill. They're not familiar, they're not exposed to a lot of checks. And so when a fraudster writes a bad check, that's a lot less obvious to those folks than it might be to somebody that's been using checks on a daily basis for decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere being a blind spot for everybody, but younger generations, I think the key one for them is checks, as well as social media scams, I think, are particularly common for younger generations as well. I mentioned the artist on Instagram, like royalty kind of scam earlier in the presentation. That person was in their late teens. This is, I think, one of those things where they are on these platforms a lot more than some older folks might be, generally speaking of course. And they aren't as familiar with how the world works and maybe don't know the ins and outs of how that kind of interaction like a royalty, or a commission, or whatever is supposed to go. And so yeah, social media scams, particularly Instagram for some reason, and checks, are the ones that we see for younger generations the most.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor middle-aged folks, maybe 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, that kind of deal, the thing that we see the most for them, there's cryptocurrency and then just broader investment or lottery scams. And the reason, I think, that we see these the most is that FOMO, that fear of missing out that I talked about earlier. Because they are, I think, a little more financially savvy, they're a little more aware of how the world works, they're not necessarily going to be as liable to fall for a tech scam, that kind of thing, but they are worried about falling behind. There's a fear of being behind in terms of financial planning for retirement, for maybe college for the kids. Whatever way the fear manifests, I think that that's a lot more common in this demographic. We see a lot of folks, maybe in their 40s or 50s, that are falling for some kind of cryptocurrency scam because they don't want to admit that maybe they're not super-duper up to speed with the latest and greatest in technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so they're not as aware of what a scam might look like in those circumstances, and they are willing to turn a little bit of a blind eye just out of a sense of maybe of pride. I could try to psychoanalyze this all day, and ultimately, that's not what my degree is in, that's not what my job is in. What my job is in is helping the folks that fall victim to this kind of thing. And I think, yeah, the fear of being behind in financial planning or fear of missing out on some kind of investment opportunity that will set them up for later in life, I think, weighs pretty heavily on middle-aged folks. And so that's something that we see them being victims of a little more often than maybe other demographics might be.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then for older generations, the things that we see are ones that I think a lot of people are probably kind of familiar with because it gets talked about more. And to those of us that aren't part of that demographic, it seems like a very obvious scam, because again, it's that blind spot thing. We see grandparent scams, which somebody calls the grandparent posing as the grandkid and they are traveling out of the country in maybe a place that has a little bit of corruption in the government and they're like, \\u0022I've been arrested and they'll let me go if I can post bail, but I don't have the money here because I'm traveling. And please, please, please don't tell my parents and I need your help.\\u0022 And of course, they want to help their family. Of course they do. And the grandchildren in particular, of all the people, they're so motivated to help and to do something here, and so they're much more willing to send the funds and not talk about it with anybody because the grandkid doesn't want to be embarrassed and that kind of thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see grandparent scams of kids being in danger, needing bail, traveling. Maybe it's a medical emergency overseas. It usually has something to do with traveling and has that same like, oh, it needs to be urgent, so that they don't think about it, and they don't talk to anybody, and they just send the money. The other one that we see pretty often with older folks I talked about earlier, it's the romance scams. I think a lot of folks later in life when they don't have coworkers, when they maybe don't have the same social activities and network that younger generations might, they are more liable to fall victim to romance scams. And so that's something that we see more commonly with older generations as well, which I know I've spoken about at previous slides.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I know we're getting close to our time limit here, so this last section, fortunately, is pretty straightforward. It's, what can I do? All right, you've explained what the fraud looks like. You've explained why I need to care about it. I'm convinced. What can I do when stuff like this happens? And so you might be thinking about if you've ever been scammed or somebody that you know got scammed and what do you do when it's you? What do you do when it's someone that you are close with? And the first thing I want to say here is that we're here for you. Your credit union is here for you. We have a whole team. There's a fraud department whose job it is to help keep you and your money safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if you find that you have fallen victim to some kind of scam, they are available as a resource. You call the call center, you go into your local branch, you tell them what's going on, and in some cases that can just get handled by the contact center, and in other cases it gets escalated up to the fraud department. But there's a reason they're around and it's to help you in times of crisis. There is not judgment, there is not punishment, there is just making sure that you are safe, your money is safe, and that everything is okay.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo first things first, stay educated. Stay up to date on what's going on. Stay up to date on what fraud is, what it looks like, what to do about it. For example, this webinar, if you're here, if you're watching the recorded version of this, great, you have taken a step that the overwhelming majority of people haven't. And I guarantee it's going to be a net benefit for you in some way, whether that's that you spot something that's pitched to you and you go, \\u0022Wait a second, that's a scam. I'm not even going to touch that with a 10-foot pole.\\u0022 Great. That made the difference. Maybe it's somebody that you know and you're able to talk to them about it and go, \\u0022Actually, I learned about this the other day, and trust me, you don't want to get involved in that.\\u0022 So learning how to spot fraud for yourself, learning what it looks like, learning why people might fall for different things, what those different things are, all that kind of stuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's what's going to keep you the safest because you'll be able to avoid it before you get entangled with it. So it's that whole, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The whole creating a sense of urgency. All of these little things that you can keep in the back of your mind as you go about your day. Stay connected. Scammers want to isolate you. Whether that's the grandparent call where they're like, \\u0022Please don't tell my parents I need your help and I need it fast.\\u0022 Or it's the, \\u0022We're the IRS and we're going to sue you into oblivion if you don't send us the 5,000 you owe back taxes.\\u0022 Or whatever form of fraud it is, the scammer wants you to act quickly, and they want you to send the money without thinking about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey want to keep you isolated because the second that you start to talk to somebody else about it that's not involved in the scam, the second that you start to get to think about it critically, and take a moment, and slow down, and actually process it, you're going to figure out that it's nonsense. And so by staying connected, talking to your family, your friends, your neighbors, you can have these people that you can rely on to help you realize if you've been scammed. And you can also talk to them and help them realize if they're in the same boat. Building that trust, building that community does a lot to make sure that when somebody feels like they're in a crisis, they're willing to share that with you and you can intervene and go, \\u0022That's a scam. Don't listen to them. Don't send them that money. We're going to get through this and we're going to make sure that you're okay.\\u0022 So I think just keeping in communication does a huge amount to prevent this kind of thing from happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey want to keep you from doing the research. You need to slow down. Just staying connected is so critical for this kind of thing. And then the last thing is you need to let the right people know when something happens. Like I talked about before, talk to your financial institution. Every financial institution has some form of a fraud or financial crime department. They are there to help you and they're a fantastic resource. Talk to the credit bureaus if it's something that has affected your credit. If it's something like identity theft, talk to other credit bureaus, put a freeze on your credit, so that when a fraudster tries to take out a credit card in your name, they can't. And not only does that keep you safe, but that lets whatever institution is dealing with that loan application know that, \\u0022Hey, that person's a fraudster.\\u0022\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if enough instances of this happen, you can start to get law enforcement involved and you can start to get to a point where maybe something can be done to actually bring the fraudster to justice. And speaking of law enforcement, law enforcement's another crucial one. If you are worried about your safety, if you are worried about this fraudster being local, like a Craigslist scam like we talked about earlier, it's absolutely worth involving law enforcement. They, just like the credit union or other financial institution, they've got a whole financial crime division, they've got training in this kind of stuff, they are a valuable resource in terms of preventing anything worse from happening, and fingers crossed, being able to do something to actually bring a fraudster to justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot sure why that came up separately, but law enforcement, we've talked about it. And so I know I think I've gone a little bit over time here, and I apologize for that, but that's the gist of it. That's what we needed to cover. That is what you need to look for when it comes to fraud. That is what you need to be aware of. Why you should be aware of all this stuff in the first place, even if you haven't been a victim or anything like that. And lastly, what you actually do about it if something happens or what you should do to make sure that it doesn't happen in the first place. So if there's any questions at this point, I am all ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eStephanie Loscalzo:\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you so much. This was great. We have no questions, so I hope everyone enjoys the rest of their day. There is a survey that will pop up once this ends. And there is also, this recording will be on our website in a similar spot where you found the ability to sign up for this webinar, there will be a recording in that space. So if you need to revisit any of this information, you can. Please share with your friends.

Yet, many individuals still find themselves intimidated by financial jargon and complex concepts. Enter artificial intelligence (AI) – a powerful tool that can bridge the gap between confusion and clarity in personal finance. This article explores how AI can enhance financial literacy, empowering individuals to make informed financial decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe rise of AI in personal finance\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nAI has made significant strides in various fields, including personal finance. While AI's role in investment advice is still debatable due to the personalized nature of investing, its potential to aid financial education is undeniable. AI tools like ChatGPT can demystify complex financial terms and concepts, making them accessible to everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eUnderstanding financial concepts with AI\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nOne of the primary barriers to financial literacy is the complex terminology.

AI tools can break down these concepts into simpler terms. For instance, you can ask an AI tool to \\u0022explain compound interest at a fifth-grade level,\\u0022 and it will provide an easy-to-understand explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere’s how Microsoft’s Copilot responded when I asked it to explain compound interest at a fifth-grade level:\\r\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003eSure, let's make it simple and fun!\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine you have a magic piggy bank. At the end of each year, this piggy bank gives you extra money based on how much is already inside. The more money you have in the piggy bank, the more extra money you get. This is the basic idea of compound interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet's say you start with $10 in your piggy bank. And let's say your piggy bank gives you 10% extra each year. So, at the end of the first year, you get $1 extra (because 10% of $10 is $1), so now you have $11.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere's where the magic happens. In the second year, the piggy bank gives you 10% not just on your original $10, but on the full $11. So, you get $1.10 extra (because 10% of $11 is $1.10), and now you have $12.10.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year, the amount of extra money you get increases because it's based on the total amount in the piggy bank, which includes the extra money from previous years. That's why it's called \\u0022compound\\u0022 interest - the interest is added to the total, and then you earn interest on that new total, and this process repeats year after year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, compound interest is like a snowball rolling down a hill. As it rolls, it picks up more snow and gets bigger and bigger. The longer it rolls, the bigger it gets! That's the power of compound interest. It can help your money grow faster over time. Isn't that cool?\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\r\\nComplex concepts are made digestible through simple language and relatable analogies. For example, APR (Annual Percentage Rate) can be confusing, but AI can explain it as the cost of borrowing money on a yearly basis, including interest and fees, like  the tax and tip on a dinner bill or the “rent” you pay on the loan. This approach removes the intimidation factor and fosters better understanding. Plus, you can always ask follow-up questions to continue your learning journey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEnhance learning with AI\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nFinancial education often traditionally involves \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/four-of-the-best-finance-books-to-read-for-financial-literacy-month/\\u0022\\u003ereading books\\u003c/a\\u003e, attending seminars, or watching videos. While these are effective, they may not address individual learning paces and styles. AI can complement these methods by providing personalized learning experiences. Users can interact with AI tools, ask questions, and receive instant, customized responses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAI can also adapt to the user's knowledge level. If a user has a \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-to-make-a-budget/\\u0022\\u003ebasic understanding of budgeting\\u003c/a\\u003e but struggles with more advanced topics like \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/debt-consolidation-strategies-a-path-to-financial-freedom/\\u0022\\u003edebt management\\u003c/a\\u003e, the AI can tailor its explanations to build on the user's existing knowledge. This personalized approach ensures that users are neither overwhelmed nor under-challenged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eOvercoming the fear of asking questions\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nMany people hesitate to ask questions about finances for fear of sounding uneducated. This fear can hinder learning and lead to poor financial decisions. AI tools can eliminate this barrier by providing a judgment-free environment. You can ask AI any question, no matter how basic, and receive a clear, non-judgmental answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis feature is particularly beneficial in educational settings. Financial educators can integrate AI tools into their teaching methods, encouraging students to engage more freely without the fear of embarrassment. This interactive learning can significantly improve comprehension and retention of financial concepts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003ePractical applications of AIin financial literacy\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eBudgeting\\u003c/strong\\u003e: AI tools can help users create and manage budgets. By inputting income and expenses, users can receive tailored advice on how to allocate funds effectively. For example, AI can suggest saving strategies or highlight unnecessary expenditures. This hands-on approach to budgeting can transform a daunting task into a manageable one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSaving\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Understanding different saving options is essential for financial growth.

AI should not replace professional financial advice, especially for complex decisions. Users should use AI as a supplementary resource and consult financial advisors for personalized guidance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, data privacy is a significant concern. Users should ensure that the AI tools they use comply with data protection regulations and handle their information responsibly. It's crucial to read privacy policies and understand how your data will be used and stored.\\r\\n\\r\\nAI tools also rely on the data they have been trained on, which means they might not always have the most up-to-date or comprehensive information. Users should cross-check important financial information and updates from reliable sources to ensure accuracy. AI tools can often “hallucinate,” a term used to describe when they make up information but “think” it is correct. This is why it’s useful to use AI as a jumping-off-point. Trust but verify, as they say!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eConclusion\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nAI has the potential to revolutionize financial literacy by making complex concepts accessible to everyone. By leveraging AI tools, individuals can enhance their understanding of personal finance, make informed decisions, and achieve financial well-being. As technology continues to evolve, the integration of AI in financial education will undoubtedly become more prevalent, empowering more people to take control of their financial futures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAdditional reading\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.ft.com/content/59b1a3cf-aee0-42b0-85fb-1a00a9162696\\u0022\\u003eAI and Financial Literacy: How Technology Can Help You Understand Money Better\\u003c/a\\u003e – Financial Times\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/does-generative-ai-solve-the-financial-literacy-problem/\\u0022\\u003eDoes Generative AI Solve the Financial Literacy Problem?\\u003c/a\\u003e – Knowledge at Wharton\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/does-generative-ai-solve-the-financial-literacy-problem/\\u0022\\u003eHow One Nonprofit Is Turning to AI To Help Boost Women’s Financial Literacy\\u003c/a\\u003e – CNBC.COM\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66ec191b2fb17\"} /-->",

The interest rates can be variable, potentially increasing over time. Additionally, you may be required to pay closing costs and other fees. It’s crucial to conduct thorough research and consider all your options before deciding.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan data-ccp-props=\\u0022{\\u0026quot;201341983\\u0026quot;:0,\\u0026quot;335559739\\u0026quot;:0,\\u0026quot;335559740\\u0026quot;:240}\\u0022\\u003e \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cspan data-ccp-props=\\u0022{\\u0026quot;201341983\\u0026quot;:0,\\u0026quot;335559739\\u0026quot;:160,\\u0026quot;335559740\\u0026quot;:259}\\u0022\\u003e \\u003c/span\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cspan data-ccp-props=\\u0022{\\u0026quot;201341983\\u0026quot;:0,\\u0026quot;335559739\\u0026quot;:160,\\u0026quot;335559740\\u0026quot;:259}\\u0022\\u003eAdditional tips and considerations\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003cspan data-contrast=\\u0022auto\\u0022\\u003eConsolidating debt is just the first step - to maintain financial stability, you need to address the \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-money-scripts-influence-financial-behavior-and-how-to-change-them/\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan data-contrast=\\u0022none\\u0022\\u003eunderlying habits and behaviors\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e \\u003cspan data-contrast=\\u0022auto\\u0022\\u003ethat led to debt in the first place.

However, the excitement of planning a getaway can often be dampened by the reality of a tight budget. Fear not, for with a bit of creativity and strategic planning, an unforgettable spring break doesn't have to break the bank. This guide is tailored for those who seek adventure, relaxation, and new experiences without the hefty price tag, and while it doesn't explicitly focus on Vermont, the savvy Vermonter will find these tips particularly useful.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEarly planning is key\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nThe early bird gets the best deals! If you start planning months in advance, you’ll get a wider window to monitor flight prices, accommodation rates, and car rental deals. Try utilizing travel websites like \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.kayak.com\\u0022\\u003eKayak\\u003c/a\\u003e or \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.google.com/travel/flights?hl=en\\u0022\\u003eGoogle Flights\\u003c/a\\u003e to set up alerts to get notified when prices are low. Remember, flexibility with your travel dates can lead to significant savings, as flying mid-week or during off-peak hours often results in cheaper fares.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEmbrace alternative destinations\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nWhile warm tropical beaches and palm trees may be the first images that spring to mind when you think of spring break, there's a whole world of less-trodden paths waiting to be explored. Consider destinations that are not typical spring break hotspots, as fewer people will be looking for travel and accommodations there. This means that travel and accommodations providers, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/tips-for-making-last-minute-travel-plans-on-a-budget/#:~:text=REDUCE%20AIRFARE\\u0022\\u003eespecially airlines\\u003c/a\\u003e, will be offering deals to travel to on routes that are under booked based on their expected demand or to offload demand from high-trafficked ones. The additional benefit for you is that these places can also offer a respite from the crowds!\\n\\nTraveling internationally to unique and lesser traveled locations can be an exciting adventure, but it can also bring about a unique set of anxieties. From language barriers to unfamiliar customs, the unknowns of international travel can seem daunting. However, with a bit of preparation and an open mind\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-to-overcome-these-eight-common-international-travel-anxieties/\\u0022\\u003e, these anxieties can be managed\\u003c/a\\u003e. Embrace the unknown and enjoy the journey!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eSeek out budget accommodations\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nGone are the days when hotels were the only viable accommodation option. The rise of vacation rental platforms has revolutionized where and how travelers can stay. For the budget-conscious, consider renting a room in a house rather than the entire property, or look into hostels and budget hotels. If you’re going as a group, renting out an entire property and splitting the cost is a great way to save money and spend more time together rather than being isolated to separate rooms in a resort or hotel. Another cost-effective option is camping, especially in places where nature's beauty is in abundance. Not only does camping save money, it also offers a unique way to connect with the destination.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003ePack smart and prepare meals\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nA significant portion of travel expenses can come from dining out for every meal. To save money, consider packing snacks and preparing some meals yourself. Even if you're staying in a hotel, you can still make simple, no-cook meals with ingredients from a local grocery store. For those venturing into the great outdoors, a portable stove and a cooler can turn a campsite into a gourmet kitchen under the stars. This approach not only saves money but also allows for healthier eating options.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eTake advantage of free activities\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nNo matter where you go, there's almost always a wealth of free activities to enjoy. From hiking trails and public beaches to free museums and historical sites, doing a bit of research ahead of time can uncover a treasure trove of cost-free experiences. Additionally, many cities offer free walking tours, which can be a great way to learn about the destination from a local's perspective. For Vermonters, the Northeast is rich in history and natural beauty, offering endless opportunities for exploration without spending a dime. Sometimes there is nothing more rewarding than exploring your own backyard spring, summer, fall and winter!\\n\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/5-bike-paths-and-rail-trails-to-explore-this-summer-in-vermont/\\u0022\\u003eIn the warmer months, Vermont’s network of bike paths and rail trails offer a unique way to experience the state’s idyllic summers\\u003c/a\\u003e. You can traverse the landscape, stop at landmarks, and enjoy the fresh air, all while getting a workout. The Island Line Trail and the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail are particularly noteworthy. As the leaves turn in the fall, Vermont reveals more of its hidden gems. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/things-to-do-this-fall-some-of-vermonts-hidden-gems/\\u0022\\u003eThe Falls of Lana trail in Salisbury and Lake Willoughby in the Northeast Kingdom offer captivating views and hiking opportunities\\u003c/a\\u003e. Even the cemeteries, like the Green Mountain Cemetery in Montpelier, become intriguing places to wander. When winter arrives, don’t retreat indoors. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/seven-fun-things-to-do-this-winter-for-free/\\u0022\\u003eEmbrace the season by exploring hiking trails like Camel’s Hump in Duxbury, Wheeler Mountain in Sutton, and the Owls Head and Silver Ledge trails in Groton State Forest\\u003c/a\\u003e. You can even try winter camping in Vermont’s state parks. So, no matter the season, Vermont is a playground for those who seek adventure and natural beauty. It truly is a treasure trove of cost-free experiences waiting to be discovered.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eUse public transportation\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nRenting a car can be one of the biggest travel expenses, especially when you factor in the cost of gas and parking. Whenever possible, use public transportation to get around. Many destinations offer tourist passes that include unlimited rides on buses and trains, as well as discounts on attractions. Many large cities, such as New York and London, do not even require you to get a card to use public transportation, instead relying on Apple Pay and Android Pay to get you on subways and trains. Not only is this a more budget-friendly option, but it can offer you a more authentic travel experience as you are immersed in an experience different from your own routine.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eTravel in groups\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nTraveling with friends or family can lead to significant savings. Many accommodations offer group rates, and the cost of rental cars and gas can be split among multiple people. Additionally, cooking meals for a group is often more cost-effective than cooking for one. Group travel also means shared experiences, which can make your spring break even more memorable! If I could magically get all my close friends together for a weekend, I can imagine nothing better than being together in the same accommodation, hanging out, cooking, and just relaxing together.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eBe mindful of hidden costs\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nFinally, be wary of hidden costs that can add up quickly. These can include resort fees, parking charges, and luggage fees on flights. Read the fine print and ask questions before booking to avoid any unpleasant surprises. Additionally, set a daily budget for incidental expenses such as souvenirs and snacks to keep your spending in check.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nIn conclusion, planning a spring break on a budget requires a bit of foresight, flexibility, and creativity, but it's entirely possible to have a memorable vacation without overspending. By embracing alternative destinations, seeking out budget accommodations, and taking advantage of free activities, you can enjoy a well-deserved break that won't strain your finances. Whether you're exploring the natural wonders of the Northeast or venturing further afield, the key to a budget-friendly spring break is planning with a purpose. So, pack your bags, set your sights on adventure, and prepare to make lasting memories without the financial hangover.\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"row_background_color\":\"white\",\"_row_background_color\":\"field_5e2f5d26eaae3\",\"horizontal_rule\":\"0\",\"_horizontal_rule\":\"field_5989fb5734d75\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66b2646178322\"} /-->",

A \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://twitter.com/erichoke/status/1672754628524404736\\u0022\\u003eviral sentiment making the rounds\\u003c/a\\u003e highlights a common piece of advice turned on its head: that daily $5 iced latte adds up to $25 a week, $100 a month, and $1,200 a year. Over a decade, this amounts to $12,000—a significant sum, yet, as the post wryly notes, still \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-much-are-closing-costs-on-a-mortgage/\\u0022\\u003enot enough for a down payment on a house in many markets\\u003c/a\\u003e. So, the conclusion? Enjoy your espresso in peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis perspective offers a refreshing take on the age-old debate of small pleasures versus financial prudence. Personal finance is not just about the numbers; it’s about finding a balance that allows for both future security and present enjoyment. Here’s why embracing your daily espresso can be part of a balanced financial life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe value of small pleasure\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nSmall pleasures, like your morning latte, are not merely frivolous expenses; \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/roi-on-the-10-best-purchases-that-i-ever-made/\\u0022\\u003ethey’re investments in your daily happiness and well-being\\u003c/a\\u003e. They can be a source of comfort, a ritual that starts your day on the right note, or a moment of peace in a hectic schedule. The value of these moments cannot be quantified solely in dollars and cents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eUnderstanding opportunity cost\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nThe concept of opportunity cost—the idea that choosing one thing inherently means giving up the opportunity to do something else with those resources—is crucial in personal finance. However, it’s also important to consider the opportunity cost of not enjoying the small things in life. The joy and satisfaction derived from these moments might outweigh the potential financial gain from forgoing them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eLong-term financial planning\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/eleven-steps-to-buying-a-home/\\u0022\\u003eSaving for a down payment on a house\\u003c/a\\u003e is a significant financial goal that requires discipline and planning. While it’s true that $12,000 over ten years might not cover a down payment, it’s also true that financial planning is not an all-or-nothing game. A comprehensive financial plan can accommodate small pleasures by adjusting other areas of spending or \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-to-start-a-side-hustle-and-make-extra-money/\\u0022\\u003efinding creative ways to increase income\\u003c/a\\u003e. It’s about balance, not deprivation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEnjoyment without guilt\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nThe key to enjoying your espresso in peace lies in conscious spending. This means making financial decisions intentionally, aligning your spending with your values and goals. If your morning coffee brings you joy and doesn’t impede your long-term financial objectives, then it’s a worthwhile expense. The goal is to enjoy the present while being mindful of the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eFinal thoughts\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nUnderstanding the impact of your financial choices is crucial, but so is maintaining a quality of life that brings you happiness.

The architectural charm that makes these homes unique often comes with less-than-modern insulation and outdated heating systems. However, with the right approach, you can heat your historic home efficiently and keep costs down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eUnderstanding your home’s heating needs\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nThe first step in efficiently heating any home, especially a historic one, is understanding its specific needs. This involves assessing the current insulation, identifying drafts, and understanding the home's heating history. A \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.efficiencyvermont.com/services/energy-assessments/home-energy-assessments\\u0022\\u003eprofessional energy audit\\u003c/a\\u003e can provide valuable insights into these areas. It can help identify areas where heat is being lost, suggest improvements, and provide a roadmap for maximizing heating efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWeatherization\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/budgeting-and-financing-for-weatherization-and-home-efficiency/\\u0022\\u003eWeatherization\\u003c/a\\u003e, the process of protecting a home against the elements, can significantly reduce heating costs. This can involve adding insulation, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/air-sealing-and-insulating-for-seasonal-comfort/\\u0022\\u003esealing drafts\\u003c/a\\u003e, and installing energy-efficient windows. Remember, the less heat your home loses, the less energy you'll need to heat it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeatherization can be particularly important in historic homes, which often lack modern insulation and can be drafty. Adding insulation to the attic and walls, sealing gaps around windows and doors, and even using heavy curtains or window film can all help keep heat in and cold out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHeating systems for historic homes\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nWhen it comes to heating systems, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/energy-efficient-home-heating-options/\\u0022\\u003ehistoric homeowners have several options\\u003c/a\\u003e. Let's explore some of the most efficient ones:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRadiant Heating\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nRadiant heating systems, such as underfloor heating, can be an excellent choice for historic homes. These systems heat objects and people directly, rather than heating the air, resulting in a more efficient transfer of heat. While installation can be invasive, it's often worth the initial cost and disruption for the long-term benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadiant heating also has the advantage of being largely invisible once installed, preserving the aesthetic of your historic home. It can be used with a variety of flooring types, including wood, tile, and carpet, and provides a comfortable, even heat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eHeat Pumps\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/the-heat-pump-an-energy-efficient-heating-and-cooling-option/\\u0022\\u003eHeat pumps are another efficient heating option\\u003c/a\\u003e. They work by extracting heat from the outside air (even when it's cold!) and transferring it inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeat pumps can be a good fit for historic homes for several reasons. They can be used with existing ductwork, or with ductless mini-split systems for homes without ducts. They're also quiet, efficient, and can provide both heating and cooling, making them a versatile choice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eHigh-Efficiency Boilers and Furnaces\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your historic home already has a boiler and radiator system, consider upgrading to a high-efficiency boiler. Modern boilers can reach efficiencies of up to 95%, providing significant savings over older models.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh-efficiency boilers can be a particularly good choice for homes with existing radiator systems. They can often be installed with minimal changes to the existing system, and can provide comfortable, even heat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eSmart thermostats\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nNo matter what heating system you choose, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/buy-the-best-smart-thermostat-and-still-save-money/\\u0022\\u003ea smart thermostat can help maximize its efficiency\\u003c/a\\u003e. These devices allow for precise control over your home's temperature and can learn your schedule, adjusting the heat automatically to save energy when you're not home.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmart thermostats can also provide valuable data about your home's energy use, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/buy-the-best-smart-thermostat-and-still-save-money/\\u0022\\u003ehelping you identify patterns and make adjustments\\u003c/a\\u003e to save even more. Many models can be controlled remotely via a smartphone app, making it easy to adjust the temperature even when you're not home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eRegular maintenance\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nFinally, regular maintenance of your heating system can go a long way to ensuring its efficiency. This includes annual servicing of boilers or heat pumps and regular checks for drafts and insulation issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegular maintenance can help catch small issues before they become big problems and can ensure that your system is operating at peak efficiency. It's a small investment that can pay off in lower energy bills and a more comfortable home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, heating a historic home efficiently involves a combination of understanding your home's specific needs, weatherization, choosing the right heating system, and regular maintenance. With these steps, you can enjoy the charm of your historic home with lower energy costs. By taking a comprehensive approach to heating, you can ensure that your historic home is warm, comfortable, and energy-efficient, all while preserving its unique character.\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66df0ce23b71d\"} /-->",

When done right, budgeting gives you control over your money so you can allocate it towards what matters most to you.

By separating your money into these labeled envelopes, you can clearly see how much remains for each type of expense throughout the month. Envelope budgeting brings your budget to life in a concrete, visual way that sets defined limits on your spending and promotes mindful purchasing decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eIdentify your fixed and variable expenses, assigning amounts to allocate to envelopes.

Carry digital envelopes in your phone.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eOnly spend directly from the designated envelopes.

Carefully moving money between envelopes provides some relief when needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eBank withdrawal limits.\\u003c/strong\\u003e Most banks limit how much cash you can withdraw each month, so very large monthly budgets may be inconvenient to implement with physical cash envelopes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCoin buildup.\\u003c/strong\\u003e Over time, you may end up accumulating a lot of coins in your envelopes that will need to be exchanged for cash at the bank which can be time consuming.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eBest of both worlds: try blending digital and cash envelopes\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nThe best of both worlds may be implementing a hybrid approach that thoughtfully incorporates elements of physical cash envelopes and digital envelope budgeting apps.\\r\\n\\r\\nApps like \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.ynab.com/\\u0022\\u003eYou Need A Budget (YNAB)\\u003c/a\\u003e, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://goodbudget.com/\\u0022\\u003eGoodbudget\\u003c/a\\u003e, and \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.ramseysolutions.com/ramseyplus/everydollar\\u0022\\u003eEveryDollar\\u003c/a\\u003e provide digital envelopes to categorize your money without dealing with actual cash. This allows conveniences like automatic tracking, mobile access, digital-only bank transfers between envelopes, and instant spending feedback.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for some expenses like groceries, gas, and family activities, physical cash envelopes have a tangible psychological benefit when spending.

But figuring out exactly how much to save can be confusing for many people. Should you aim to save a set dollar amount every month? A percentage of your income? Just whatever money is left over at the end of each month?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seven percent savings rule provides a simple yet powerful guideline—save seven percent of your gross income before any taxes or other deductions come out of your paycheck. Saving at this level can help you make continuous progress towards your financial goals through the inevitable ups and downs of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore what the seven percent rule is, why saving seven percent of your income can have such a big impact, how to implement the rule in your own finances, and common questions people have about this savings methodology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhat is the seven percent savings rule?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nThe seven percent savings rule recommends saving seven percent of your gross salary each year. Gross salary is your income before any taxes, health insurance, retirement contributions, or other deductions are taken out of your paycheck.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, if you earn $50,000 per year, you would aim to save $3,500 annually, or around $292 per month. Simple right? By saving consistently at this seven percent level year after year, your money can grow tremendously over time through the power of compound interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhy seven percent?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nSaving seven percent of your income may not seem like a lot, especially compared to more aggressive goals like saving 15% or 20% of your income. However, saving at the seven percent level provides two key benefits:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eIt allows your money to grow through compound interest. Compound interest is when the interest you earn begins to earn interest itself. When repeated over many years, even small amounts saved can snowball into significant sums.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eIt aligns with common retirement planning guidelines. Many financial experts recommend saving 10-15% of your income annually for retirement. Since many employers match 3-5% of income in retirement accounts, the seven percent rule gets you well on your way towards meeting typical retirement savings targets.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, you can always save more than seven percent if possible, but saving at this level helps ensure you are saving enough to see meaningful growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow to implement the seven percent savings rule\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nPutting the seven percent rule into action is simple:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eCalculate seven percent of your gross annual income. For example, seven percent of $50,000 is $3,500.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eDivide this amount by 12 to get your monthly savings target. In our example, $3,500 divided by 12 equals monthly savings of $291.67, or rounded up to $292.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eSet up automatic transfers from your paycheck to direct this monthly amount into your savings accounts. Automating your savings is key—it helps make sure you save consistently without having to manually move money each month.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eGrab any extra income like raises, bonuses, tax refunds or gifts and use them to give your savings a boost. These irregular sources of income can be great opportunities to bump up your savings rate.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eReview your progress twice per year. Make any needed adjustments to keep working towards your goals. Celebrate your savings milestones along the way!\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCustomizing the seven percent rule for your situation\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nThe seven percent rule is intended as a guideline, not a hard and fast rule. Your specific circumstances may call for tweaking this approach. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eRecent graduates or those just starting their careers may need to begin with a smaller percentage, like 3-5%, as they establish themselves. You can incrementally increase your savings rate over time as your income grows. The key is developing the savings habit!\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eIf you got a late start on saving, you may need to play catch up by saving at a higher rate like 10-15% of your income. If possible, maximize your contributions to grow your savings rapidly.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eIf you have high interest debt like credit card balances, focus on paying off that debt before directing money into long-term savings. Cutting high interest debt will help you more than savings in this case.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eIf your employer offers a retirement match, be sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is free money you don’t want to leave on the table!\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eConsider splitting your savings between different goals like retirement, emergency savings, big purchases, etc. You can tailor your percentages for each goal.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important thing is to challenge yourself to save consistently. Automate it so your savings happen effortlessly over time. Grab extra cash, when possible, to give your savings a boost. Develop diligent savings habits now to reap the benefits later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhy starting early and saving consistently matters\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nOne of the biggest benefits of the seven percent rule is that saving at this level starting early in your career gives compound interest more time to work its magic.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo show why starting early is so critical, let's compare how savings grow for two people who both save seven percent of their $50,000 incomes, but one starts saving at twenty-five and the other waits until thirty-five to begin:\\r\\n\\r\\nTom starts saving $292 per month at twenty-five and continues until age sixty-five. Thanks to compound growth at a 7% rate of return, Tom’s $140,000 in contributions turns into over $766,000 by sixty-five.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaria waits until thirty-five to begin saving $292 per month until sixty-five. She contributes $105,120, but her savings only grow to around $356,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom ended up with over double the savings, simply by giving his money ten more years to grow! This example shows why consistent saving early on is so powerful. Time gives your money the chance to work harder for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCommon questions about the seven percent savings rule\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nStill have questions about implementing the seven percent rule? Here are answers to some commonly asked questions:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eShould I save seven percent in my 401(k) or separately?\\r\\n\\u003c/strong\\u003eThe seven percent rule looks at your overall savings, so it doesn’t matter if you save specifically in your 401(k) versus another account. If your employer offers a 401(k) match, be sure to contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eWhat if I can't afford seven percent?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nIf you’re just starting out, beginning with even 1-2% in savings can help build your savings muscle. Raise your rate by 1% each year until you reach 7%. The habit of consistent saving is what matters most.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDoes the seven percent rule apply after I max out my 401(k)?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nYes, the seven percent goal looks at your total annual savings, including what you contribute to your 401(k). Should you max out your allowed 401Kk) contributions prior to the end of the year, you will want to continue saving by adding funds to other tax-advantage accounts or savings vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eWhat if I don't need as much for retirement, should I still save seven percent?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nIf you run retirement projections and decide you don’t need to save as much as recommended , you can adjust your overall savings rate accordingly. The seven percent is just a general guideline, so do what makes sense for your situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eWhat if I want to retire early?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\r\\nTo retire significantly before age sixty-five, you will likely need to save more aggressively—likely over 15%.

While winter in Vermont can be beautiful, it certainly brings with it unique challenges for homeowners. To help you prepare, we have created an essential fall home maintenance checklist.\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eInspect and clean your gutters\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nFall in Vermont means an abundance of leaves, which can clog your gutters and downspouts. A clogged gutter could result in water damage to your home’s roof and facade. Snow melt that is blocked from draining will turn to ice and build up over time, making its way between gaps in the edge of your roof and creating extensive damage.  Make sure to clean out your gutters and check for any necessary repairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eSeal doors and windows\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nVermont winters can be chilly, and \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/air-sealing-and-insulating-for-seasonal-comfort/\\u0022\\u003edrafts from windows and doors can significantly increase your heating costs\\u003c/a\\u003e. Use weatherstripping or caulk to seal any leaks and add door sweeps to your exterior doors. For windows, consider window insulation kits, which can dramatically improve your home's ability to retain heat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I think of caulk, my mind jumps immediately to the messy tubes of material that contractors use when waterproofing a bathroom or kitchen countertop, but last year I discovered that some window caulk \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.hardwarestore.com/280040-frost-king-b2-caulking-cord-90-ft-l-vinyl-gray\\u0022\\u003ecomes in a roll\\u003c/a\\u003e and can be easily applied, then removed. No tools or mess and it took only a few minutes to do!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003ePrepare your heating system\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nBefore the cold sets in, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/dos-and-donts-of-home-heating-safety/\\u0022\\u003ehave your heating system serviced by a professional\\u003c/a\\u003e. This is especially true if you use propane or oil to heat your home. Make sure whomever you hire is licensed to work on your system, and ensure they check for leaks, look for inefficiencies, and change the filter, although you can do the latter if you know what kind of filters your home heating system uses. Additionally, bleed your radiators to let out any trapped air, ensuring they run efficiently and quietly!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCheck your roof\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nSnow accumulation can be heavy in Vermont, and your roof is your home's first line of defense. Have your roof inspected for any loose or missing shingles that could leak during Vermont's winter storms. Also, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/budgeting-and-financing-for-weatherization-and-home-efficiency/\\u0022\\u003eensure your attic insulation is sufficient\\u003c/a\\u003e to prevent heat loss. Because heat rises, one of the best things you can do to reduce your heating bill is to make sure that your attic isn’t letting too much heat out!\\r\\n\\r\\nA contractor working on the insulation in my attic shared with me that the amount of snow buildup on your roof can be an indicator of the efficiency of the insulation in your attic. Right after snowfall, is there snow on your roof? If no, it’s \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.energysvc.com/what-snow-on-the-roof-can-tell-you-about-a-homes-insulation/\\u0022\\u003elikely your attic could use more insulation\\u003c/a\\u003e. Here’s a helpful graphic from \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://kapellaroofing.com/2020/10/23/attic-insulation-101-types-costs-benefits-more/\\u0022\\u003eKapella Roofing\\u003c/a\\u003e that shows what a functional attic looks like.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022size-medium wp-image-19111 aligncenter\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/files/Picture1-540x304.jpg\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Home roof graphic showing the movement of air in a good and badly insulated home\\u0022 width=\\u0022540\\u0022 height=\\u0022304\\u0022 /\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWinterize your outdoor plumbing\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nBefore the first frost, drain your outdoor faucets and irrigation systems to prevent pipes from freezing and bursting. Don't forget to disconnect and store your garden hoses indoors. Modern houses are likely to have freeze proof hose bibs, but unless you know for sure, it isn’t worth taking the risk. I personally like to be able to use the hose in the winter, so I replaced all of our house bibs with \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.aquorwatersystems.com/products/hydrant-v2-plus\\u0022\\u003ethese freeze proof connections from Aquor\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your home has a septic tank, fall is a good time to have it pumped and inspected to prevent any unpleasant surprises during the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCheck your home’s exterior\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nThis one might seem obvious, but many people don’t look for cracks or holes in their home's exterior that could allow cold air, snow, or pests inside. Pay special attention to areas where utilities and pipes enter your home. Use caulk or expanding foam insulation to seal any gaps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003ePrepare your fireplace\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nIf you're lucky enough to have a fireplace, ensure it's ready to provide cozy warmth in the winter months. Have the chimney professionally cleaned to remove soot or creosote build-up. Check the damper to make sure it opens and closes properly. Gas fireplaces don’t need the same level of maintenance, but it’s a good idea to have it checked every few years, especially if it is a primary heating element in your house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eStock up on winter essentials\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nDon't wait for the first snowfall to stock up on winter essentials. This includes snow shovels, ice scrapers, salt or ice melt, and emergency supplies in case of power outages. If you have a snow blower, check that it's in good working order.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eProtect your landscaping\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nWrap young trees or shrubs in burlap to protect them from heavy snowfall. Clear away any fallen leaves or debris from your yard and trim any branches that hang too close to your house or power lines. I like to mow the lawn as close to the first snowfall as possible but be careful not to cut the grass too short!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking the time to complete these fall home maintenance tasks can make a big difference once winter hits. Not only will your home be more comfortable and efficient, but you'll also be able to enjoy the winter season knowing you've done everything you can to protect your home. Remember, proper preparation is key to weathering a Vermont winter!\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-6724d4b83498c\"} /-->",

There are several key factors you’ll want to consider when making a decision. In this blog post, we will explore these factors to help you find the perfect credit card that suits your requirements.\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eUnderstanding your financial needs\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nBefore delving into the world of credit cards, it's essential to assess your financial needs and goals. Determine whether you want to \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/credit-history-101-how-to-build-credit-get-a-loan-with-any-credit-score/\\u0022\\u003ebuild credit\\u003c/a\\u003e, earn rewards, or finance a large purchase. Understanding your priorities will help narrow down your options and find a card that best suits your needs. Without knowing this in advance, you’ll be lost in a sea of options!\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eTypes of credit cards\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nThere are various types of credit cards available, each catering to different financial needs and preferences. Some common categories include:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRewards Cards:\\u003c/strong\\u003e These cards offer points, miles, or cash back on your purchases. They are ideal for individuals who pay their balance in full each month and want to maximize the return on their spending. Some people are passionate about maxing out their rewards on a whole portfolio of cards so that they’re not leaving a single cent on the table. This usually means having a variety of different rewards cards and utilizing them strategically at different types of businesses. If this sounds appealing, make sure you’re careful not to spend more than you can afford! A \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/the-four-best-budgeting-apps-worth-paying-for/\\u0022\\u003ebudgeting app like You Need a Budget (YNAB)\\u003c/a\\u003e can help you with this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eLow-Interest Cards\\u003c/strong\\u003e If you tend to carry a balance on your credit card, a low-interest card can help minimize interest charges. With \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cbsnews.com/news/average-credit-card-interest-rate-record-high/\\u0022\\u003ecredit card interest rates at record highs\\u003c/a\\u003e, finding a good low-interest card will be tricky, but not impossible! Bear in mind that while it is possible to start with a high-interest card and \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-to-lower-your-credit-card-interest-rate/\\u0022\\u003ework to lower that rate over time\\u003c/a\\u003e, you may not get the same results as starting with a low-interest card.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eBalance Transfer Cards\\u003c/strong\\u003e: These cards offer low or temporary 0% interest rates on balance transfers, allowing you to consolidate and pay off debt more efficiently. Usually the 0% promotions only last a few months, so it’s wise to find a card that will have a relatively low interest rate once the promotion ends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSecured Cards\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Designed for individuals with limited or poor credit, secured cards require a security deposit that serves as your credit limit. They can help you build or rebuild your credit over time. These are great if you’re a student looking to build your credit!\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eRewards programs\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nRewards programs play a significant role in choosing a credit card. Consider the following when evaluating rewards cards:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eEarning Potential\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Look for cards that offer generous rewards rates on categories where you spend the most, such as groceries, gas, or dining. My family spends a ton on food, so a card with fantastic rewards at grocery stores and restaurants is a must for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eRedemption Options\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Ensure the card offers flexible redemption options, including statement credits, travel bookings, or gift cards. Find a rewards program that aligns with your spending habits and offers valuable rewards. If you travel even once a year, being able to redeem points for travel will almost certainly be worth it in many cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSign-up Bonuses\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Many cards offer lucrative sign-up bonuses if you meet a minimum spending requirement within a specified time frame. Take advantage of these bonuses but ensure they align with your spending habits and financial goals. It’s important that you pay close attention to the terms of the card after the sign-up bonus has concluded. Many cards will hit you with high interest rates or fees after giving you a lucrative sign-up bonus.\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eInterest rates and fees\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nInterest rates and fees can significantly impact your overall credit card experience. Keep the following in mind:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAnnual Percentage Rate (APR)\\u003c/strong\\u003e: The APR is the interest rate you'll be charged if you carry a balance on your card. Look for cards with low APRs if you plan to carry a balance. Note that rewards cards often have higher APRs than more basic cards, such as those designed as balance transfer cards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eAnnual Fees:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Some cards charge an annual fee, which can range from a modest amount to several hundred dollars. Evaluate the rewards and benefits offered by the card to ensure they outweigh the cost of the fee. If benefits of the card are substantial and match your spending habits, the fee might be worth it!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eForeign Transaction Fees\\u003c/strong\\u003e: If you travel internationally, look for cards that don't charge foreign transaction fees. This will help you save on overseas purchases and make your card more convenient to use abroad. I’m often surprised by how much stuff I buy online that comes from outside the United States, so I’ve tried to make all of my cards free of foreign transaction fees.\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCredit limit and security features\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nWhen choosing a credit card, consider your credit limit and the card's security features:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCredit Limit\\u003c/strong\\u003e: A higher credit limit provides more flexibility and can \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/eight-common-credit-card-mistakes-to-avoid/\\u0022\\u003ehelp improve your credit utilization ratio\\u003c/a\\u003e, which impacts your credit score. However, it's crucial to be mindful of overspending and maintain a low balance relative to your limit to maintain healthy financial habits. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGTgALXJZl0\\u0026amp;t=6s\\u0022\\u003eCheck out this video on credit tips\\u003c/a\\u003e from a certified financial counsellor to learn more about how your credit card usage can impact your credit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSecurity Features\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Look for cards with robust security features, such as fraud alerts and the ability to lock or unlock your card through a mobile app. These features provide an additional layer of protection for your financial transactions. Large credit card companies have robust fraud detection systems, meaning you \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.americanexpress.com/us/customer-service/faq.travel-notification.html#:~:text=We%20use%20industry%2Dleading%20fraud,you%20while%20you're%20away\\u0022\\u003emay not even have to tell them you’re traveling\\u003c/a\\u003e!\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhen to use credit instead of debit\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nCredit cards offer several advantages over debit cards:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eFraud Protection\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Credit cards typically offer better fraud protection compared to debit cards. If your credit card is used fraudulently, you're \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/0-fraud-liability/\\u0022\\u003egenerally only liable for up to $50\\u003c/a\\u003e, whereas debit card liability can be much higher. This added protection gives you peace of mind when using your card for online or in-person transactions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eDispute Resolution\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Credit cards provide more robust dispute resolution processes, allowing you to dispute charges and potentially receive a refund if you're unsatisfied with a purchase. When spending with a credit card, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1643#:~:text=In%20any%20action%20by%20a,the%20unauthorized%20use%20of%20a\\u0022\\u003ethe burden of proof for a transaction is on the vendor and the credit card company\\u003c/a\\u003e. This can be particularly helpful when dealing with fraudulent or unauthorized transactions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eCredit Building\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Using a credit card responsibly can help you build credit history, which can lead to better loan terms and lower interest rates in the future. By making timely payments and keeping your credit utilization low, you can establish a positive credit profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some limited cases, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cnbc.com/select/when-is-it-better-to-use-a-debit-card-over-a-credit-card/\\u0022\\u003eit may still be appropriate to use a debit card\\u003c/a\\u003e, such as if you need to access cash quickly or are hoping to avoid additional merchant fees. However, if you are able to use your credit cards wisely and not spend more than you have, spending on credit is the better option.\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCustomer service\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nLastly, consider the quality of customer service provided by the card issuer. Look for issuers with a reputation for excellent customer support, as this can make a significant difference in your overall credit card experience. Having responsive customer service can help you resolve any issues or concerns efficiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, finding the perfect credit card involves understanding your financial needs, evaluating various card types, and considering factors such as rewards programs, interest rates, fees, credit limits, security features, and customer service. By taking the time to research and compare your options, you can find a card that maximizes your financial potential and aligns with your lifestyle.\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-6759b0c7b71c6\"} /-->",

One of the chief concerns for drivers today, regardless of their vehicle type, is maximizing fuel efficiency. This doesn't just lighten the load on your wallet, but also contributes to a greener environment by reducing CO2 emissions. So, let's dive into some strategic and easy-to-implement tips to help you get the most out of every gallon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eUnderstanding your vehicle\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nThe first step to maximizing your gas mileage is to understand your vehicle. All vehicles are not created equal and different models have different fuel efficiency capabilities. Consult your vehicle's manual or look up its EPA fuel economy ratings online to get a benchmark for its gas mileage performance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eStrategic driving\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nYour driving habits play a significant role in your vehicle's fuel consumption. Aggressive driving, like speeding, rapid acceleration, and harsh braking can lower your gas mileage by \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/driving-more-efficiently\\u0022\\u003eup to 30% at highway speeds and 40% in stop-and-go traffic\\u003c/a\\u003e. So, drive smoothly, maintain a steady speed, and avoid sudden braking or acceleration whenever possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you know that \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.aaa.com/autorepair/articles/how-to-maximize-fuel-economy\\u0022\\u003efuel economy peaks at around 50 mph\\u003c/a\\u003e for most vehicles? You’d be surprised how much of a difference dropping your speed by a few mph on the highway can save you.\\r\\n\\r\\nFun fact, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.motor1.com/news/578746/kia-music-electric-cars-study/\\u0022\\u003eKia did a study\\u003c/a\\u003e recently on the impact of different types of music on efficiency on the road. In their analysis, drivers listening to Beethoven were four times more efficient than other musical genres.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eOptimize your vehicle's condition\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/your-car-maintenance-checklist/\\u0022\\u003eRoutine maintenance\\u003c/a\\u003e is key to maximizing your vehicle's gas mileage. Regular oil changes, using the manufacturer's recommended grade of motor oil, and keeping your tires properly inflated can really make a difference on the road. Just making sure your tires are properly inflated can improve your gas mileage by \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://afdc.energy.gov/conserve/vehicle_maintenance.html\\u0022\\u003eup to 3%!\\u003c/a\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, a well-tuned engine can \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://afdc.energy.gov/conserve/vehicle_maintenance.html\\u0022\\u003eimprove gas mileage by an average of 4%,\\u003c/a\\u003e and fixing a serious problem like a \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cars.com/articles/when-should-the-oxygen-sensor-be-replaced-1420663031800/\\u0022\\u003efaulty oxygen sensor can improve mileage by as much as 40%.\\u003c/a\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eLimit idle time\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nWhen your car is idling, it's getting 0 miles per gallon. It may seem counterintuitive, but restarting your car does not burn more fuel than leaving it idling. So, if you’re going to be stopped for more than a minute, except in traffic, turn off the engine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eUse cruise control\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nCruise control is another useful tool for maximizing gas mileage. It helps maintain a constant speed, which is typically more fuel-efficient than fluctuating speeds. Be cautious, though, as using cruise control on hilly terrain can cause your vehicle to speed up faster than it would if you were controlling the throttle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eReduce extra weight\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nAn extra 100 pounds in your vehicle could \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://afdc.energy.gov/files/u/publication/10_G00888_savings_WEB.pdf\\u0022\\u003ereduce your gas mileage by up to 2%,\\u003c/a\\u003e although this tip will have a much larger impact on smaller vehicles than larger ones. So remove unnecessary weight from your vehicle. This includes items in your trunk or on your roof rack.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of roof racks, remove them when they're not in use. They can decrease fuel economy by creating wind resistance. A loaded roof rack can \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://afdc.energy.gov/files/u/publication/10_G00888_savings_WEB.pdf\\u0022\\u003edecrease your fuel economy by 5%\\u003c/a\\u003e!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003ePlan your trips\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nCombining errands into one trip helps avoid multiple cold starts of your engine and it keeps your engine warmer, which can increase fuel efficiency. So, planning your driving routes to avoid heavy traffic, road works, or other disruptions can help save fuel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eChoose the right octane fuel\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nHigher octane fuel doesn’t necessarily mean higher fuel efficiency. Most vehicles are designed to run on regular octane gasoline. Using a higher octane gas than the manufacturer recommends won't necessarily enhance performance or fuel economy. Always refer to your owner’s manual for the correct octane level for your car.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eConsider a hybrid\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\nIf you're in the market for a new car and want to maximize your gas mileage, consider a hybrid vehicle. They use a combination of an electric motor and a traditional engine, optimizing fuel efficiency by seamlessly switching between the two power sources based on driving conditions. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/hybrid-vehicle-vs-electric-car-nine-pros-and-cons-to-consider-at-the-dealership/\\u0022\\u003eWe’ve written about the pros and cons of hybrid vehicles to help you make an informed choice!\\u003c/a\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, maximizing your gas mileage is not only beneficial for your wallet, but it's also a crucial step towards reducing our collective carbon footprint. By understanding your vehicle, adopting strategic driving habits, and maintaining your car's condition, you can significantly improve your fuel efficiency. Every little bit helps, and together, we can drive towards a greener future.\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66df11fd18cec\"} /-->",

The upfront cost, anxiety about range and charging infrastructure, and the simple lack of electric models that fit certain lifestyles or needs are all valid concerns when it comes to EVs. That's where hybrid vehicles step into the fray, serving as a valuable and practical stepping stone toward a fully electric future. However, as with any automotive decision, there are pros and cons to consider.\\u003c!\\u002d\\u002dmore\\u002d\\u002d\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow hybrid vehicles work\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nSo, what exactly is a hybrid vehicle? Well, in the simplest terms, a hybrid car uses a combination of an internal combustion engine (that's the same kind your traditional car uses) and an electric motor. The car automatically switches between these two power sources based on driving conditions to optimize fuel efficiency. The most common type is a full hybrid, also known as a strong hybrid, where the vehicle can be driven by the electric motor alone for short distances. The Toyota RAV4 Hybrid falls into this category. Mild hybrids that cannot run on electric power alone still exist but are much less common.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe appeal of hybrid vehicles\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nOne of the primary attractions of hybrid vehicles is their ability to ease drivers into the world of electric mobility. Hybrid vehicles offer the fuel efficiency and environmental benefits of an electric motor, coupled with the reassurance and convenience of a traditional internal combustion engine.\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFuel Efficiency\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\nArguably, the most significant advantage of hybrid vehicles is their superior fuel efficiency. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hybrids-evs/why-hybrid-vehicles-are-a-smart-choice-right-now-a2736240282/\\u0022\\u003eAccording to Consumer Reports\\u003c/a\\u003e, most hybrid SUVs can get upwards of 35 miles per gallon, while hybrid sedans can push upwards of 45 miles per gallon!\\n\\nHybrids operate by seamlessly switching between an electric motor and a conventional gasoline engine. The vehicle's onboard computer system manages this process, optimizing for the most efficient use of energy based on driving conditions. When traveling at low speeds or short distances, the electric motor typically handles the job. When more power is needed, for instance, during highway driving, the gasoline engine takes over. This leads to fewer stops at the gas station and a reduced fuel bill, which over time can add up to \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/buying-an-electric-car-saved-me-money/\\u0022\\u003esignificant savings\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eReduced Emissions\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\nReduced carbon emissions are another compelling benefit of hybrid vehicles. Since they burn less fuel than conventional cars, hybrids release fewer pollutants into the environment. This is a notable advantage for those who are environmentally conscious but not yet ready or able to make the leap to a fully electric vehicle.\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eGovernment Incentives\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\nSome regions offer tax incentives or other benefits to encourage the purchase of hybrid vehicles. Although these tend to be less generous than those for fully electric cars, they can still make hybrids a more financially attractive option. However, it's essential to research these incentives, as they vary by location and may be subject to change. Visit \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.driveelectricvt.com/\\u0022\\u003eDrive Electric Vermont\\u003c/a\\u003e for more information.\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eRange and Infrastructure\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\nOne of the main concerns about fully electric vehicles is range anxiety—the fear of running out of battery power before reaching a charging station. With a hybrid, this concern is largely eliminated. Hybrid vehicles can typically travel as far as conventional cars on a single tank of gas. And when you do need to refuel, you can stop at any gas station. This can provide peace of mind, particularly for those who frequently travel long distances or live in areas with sparse charging infrastructure.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\n\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe drawbacks of hybrid vehicles\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nWhile the benefits are significant, there are also some drawbacks to consider when contemplating a hybrid vehicle.\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eUpfront Costs\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\nWhile hybrids can save you money in fuel costs over the life of the vehicle, they \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/do-affordable-electric-cars-exist-and-should-you-buy-one/\\u0022\\u003etypically come with a higher upfront cost\\u003c/a\\u003e compared to their conventional counterparts. This additional investment may be offset over time through fuel savings and potential tax incentives, but it does require a larger initial outlay.\\n\\nIt’s difficult to compare ownership costs directly, but you can buy the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.kia.com/us/en\\u0022\\u003eKia\\u003c/a\\u003e Niro in three versions: a standard hybrid starting at $26,590, a plug-in hybrid starting at $33,840, and an all-electric version, starting at $39,550. While Kia doesn’t offer the Niro in a gas-only version, their parent company, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.hyundaiusa.com/\\u0022\\u003eHyundai Motor Group\\u003c/a\\u003e, offers a similar car called the Kona which has a gas-only version that starts at $21,300.\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eLimited Electric Range\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\nHybrids may help alleviate range anxiety, but the trade-off is a significantly reduced electric driving range compared to fully electric vehicles. Many hybrids can only travel a limited distance on electric power alone, after which the gasoline engine kicks in. For those seeking to minimize their carbon footprint or fuel consumption, this limitation might be a significant drawback.\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eMaintenance Costs\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\nMaintenance for hybrid vehicles can potentially be more expensive than for conventional cars. While the electric components generally require less maintenance, hybrid vehicles also contain all the traditional parts of a combustion engine vehicle. This means they may still require regular oil changes, filter replacements, and other maintenance associated with traditional cars. Additionally, should the hybrid system need repairs outside of warranty, those costs can be high due to the complexity of the technology.\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eReduced Performance\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\nWhile hybrid technology has improved dramatically over the years, some drivers feel that hybrid vehicles still don't offer the same level of performance as conventional cars. Particularly, hybrids might lack the power and acceleration of their gasoline counterparts. This isn't true for all hybrids, but it's something to consider if high performance is important to you.\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eResale Uncertainty\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/thinking-of-buying-a-used-electric-car-heres-what-you-should-know/\\u0022\\u003eResale values\\u003c/a\\u003e for hybrid vehicles can be a bit uncertain. While some hybrids hold their value well, others may depreciate more quickly due to factors such as the rapidly evolving technology of electric vehicles and fluctuations in fuel prices.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eConclusion\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nHybrid vehicles serve as an appealing compromise, a symbol of the transitional period we currently inhabit, straddling the line between familiar internal combustion engines and the promising future of fully electric vehicles They offer a solution to those unable to fully commit to a purely electric vehicle, whether due to financial constraints, concerns about charging infrastructure, or range anxiety. If you're considering a new vehicle and your circumstances and preferences align, a hybrid vehicle could indeed serve as your bridge toward the future of electric mobility!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"row_background_color\":\"white\",\"_row_background_color\":\"field_5e2f5d26eaae3\",\"horizontal_rule\":\"0\",\"_horizontal_rule\":\"field_5989fb5734d75\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66b2646178322\"} /-->",

These gifts not only provide enjoyment in the moment, but they can also inspire a love of reading or imaginative play that will last long after the holidays are over.

However, all the talk of gifts and gift-giving can be overwhelming, especially when figuring out how much money to spend on each person. Sometimes we can get so caught up in finding the perfect present that we forget about the person we're buying it for! With a little bit of planning and some savvy gift-buying tactics, though, you can give without hurting your wallet. Here is what over-gifting looks like, why it is not good for your finances (not just this holiday season), and how to avoid doing it yourself.\\u003c!\\u002d\\u002dmore\\u002d\\u002d\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe downsides of over-gifting\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nOver-gifting is a common problem many face during the holiday season. It is the act of giving too many gifts to others, often to show love and appreciation. This can lead to negative consequences for both the giver and the recipient.\\n\\nOne of the most common consequences is financial strain. Purchasing an excessive number of gifts can quickly deplete a person's savings and even lead them into debt. This can create significant stress and anxiety for you. In addition, the recipient of over-gifted items may feel overwhelmed and unprepared to give back in a similar fashion, leading to negative feelings and relationships.\\n\\nAnother consequence of over-gifting is the potential for weight gain. The holiday season is often associated with an abundance of rich, sugary foods and treats. Stress and anxiety caused by giving can lead to excessive eating and weight gain. This can be detrimental to a person's health and well-being and lead to guilt and shame.\\n\\nRemember that you don’t have to over-gift to show that you like or love someone! It's just a way to be smart with your money because, like any other financial decision, giving gifts requires consideration and planning.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCommit to making gifts \\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nMaking gifts for the holiday season can be a great way to avoid overspending and still give something thoughtful and unique to your loved ones. Instead of buying gifts from a store, you can create something with your own hands that will be appreciated and cherished by the recipient.\\n\\nNot only is making gifts a more cost-effective option, but it can also be a fun and rewarding experience. You can gather your friends or family and make gifts, creating a sense of community and togetherness during the holiday season. Plus, you'll feel a sense of pride and accomplishment knowing that you made something special for someone else.\\n\\nIn addition, handmade gifts are often more meaningful and personal than store-bought items. The recipient will know that you put time, effort, and thought into creating something just for them. Plus, you can tailor the offering to the recipient's interests or needs, ensuring that they will use and enjoy it.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eSet a budget before shopping and stick to it\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nA budget is a crucial tool for avoiding overspending during the holiday season. If you're struggling with a budget, consider how much money you would need to save to avoid debt or at least reduce it. Consider setting aside a specific monthly amount to reach this goal and use it as your holiday budget when December arrives. Keeping track of your annual spending can also help prevent overspending in December.\\n\\nIt's a good idea to limit your spending on each gift and stick to it. If this sounds like something that would be difficult for you, then start by setting a maximum amount for your shopping trips (i.e., $200 per store) so that you only buy what was allocated for each trip.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eGrow your spending power\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nAnother great option is by starting a Holiday Club where $100 each month goes into an account specifically designated for holiday shopping at the end of every year—which makes it easier on everyone involved! You could even make this official by opening a particular savings account with your bank to keep track and ensure that there are always funds available in case something unexpected occurs during December!\\n\\nMake sure your credit or debit card limits are high enough to avoid declined payments when shopping online or over the phone. Some stores offer gift cards as payment options; if this is an option at checkout, check if there are any fees associated with using them.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eConsider a gift-giving group\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nDon't worry about what other people are giving this year—it's not worth stressing over! If there are more people than you have time or funds for, consider a gift-giving group where each person receives one gift (and everyone saves money!). This also allows for smaller gifts that can be personalized just for them.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eTake inventory of what you already have on hand \\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nYou may not realize it, but you don’t need to find something completely new when plenty of the items in your home could be repurposed into something special for someone else. Something in great condition that you don’t need anymore might be the perfect gift for someone else! The same goes for wrapping paper and bows; most people won't notice if they aren't exactly matching colors. My wife and I keep a large selection of bags and boxes in our basement that either came from gifts we received or gifts we have already given. That way we know we’ll always have something on hand when we want to give a gift. As soon as the recipient has opened their gift, we ask for the bag or box back! It keeps trash out of the landfill and helps us reduce our spending on wrapping.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eGet creative\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nThe best gifts are those that are both memorable and useful. You want to give someone something they'll love to receive and use repeatedly, so think of gifts that can be used for multiple purposes. If your friend loves cooking, consider giving them a fun pair of kitchen tongs or a nice vegetable peeler. If they love cooking classes but don't have much time off work during the holidays due to family obligations (like many people do), maybe give them an online cooking course instead! You could even make it into something fun by making dinner together with everyone at home while watching the video tutorials. These types of gifts have the potential to be remembered long after the holidays are over, as opposed to generic store-bought presents like socks and ties—which may soon find themselves collecting dust in the back of one's closet!\\n\\nDuring the holiday season, most people don't want extravagant or expensive gifts, . Consider giving experiences instead, like tickets to an outdoor concert or other enjoyable activity. These experiences can be even better if they occur in a warm location where no one needs gloves or coats. You could even invite friends along to make it more fun for everyone!\\n\\nWhen I’m giving gifts, I like to focus on people who will really like or appreciate them! For those that seem to take a more \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-minimalism-can-help-you-save-money-and-reduce-waste/\\u0022\\u003eminimalist approach\\u003c/a\\u003e, I try to spend time with them instead of buying an expensive gift. You could also offer other forms of generosity, like taking care of their yard work during the holiday season. One year I replaced all the exterior light fixtures for my dad! This investment will provide emotional satisfaction and improve your financial health over time.\\n\\nBy the way, if you're feeling discouraged about the environmental impact of the season, consider volunteering for organizations like Recycle Across America or the National Wildlife Federation.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eConclusion\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cspan style=\\u0022font-size: 16px;\\u0022\\u003eThe holiday season can be a stressful time for everyone. Be honest with yourself and others and consider their needs as well. Even if you're not prone to over-gifting, it can be challenging to stick to your budget or avoid impulse buys when people are spending freely around you. But if you plan carefully and stick with your goals, there's no reason this season should be any more stressful than any other one!\\u003c/span\\u003e\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"row_background_color\":\"white\",\"_row_background_color\":\"field_5e2f5d26eaae3\",\"horizontal_rule\":\"0\",\"_horizontal_rule\":\"field_5989fb5734d75\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66b2646178322\"} /-->",

This means booking your flights and accommodations as far in advance as possible. The earlier you book, the more likely you will find good deals. Additionally, consider traveling during off-peak times, such as a few days before or after a holiday. This can help you save money on flights and accommodations, and it will likely mean that you'll have fewer crowds to deal with.\\n\\nThat said, if you’re not much of a planner, you may be able to take advantage of last-minute deals if you're flexible with your travel dates. Many hotels and airlines offer discounted rates for rooms and flights that haven't been booked yet, so if you're able to be spontaneous, you could save a lot of money. Just be sure to research and compare prices before committing to one airline or hotel!\\n\\nRegarding flights, it's also a good idea to be flexible with your dates and destinations. Consider using a flight search engine, such as \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.kayak.com/\\u0022\\u003eKayak\\u003c/a\\u003e or \\u003ca href=\\u0022http://google.com/flights\\u0022\\u003eGoogle Flights\\u003c/a\\u003e, to compare prices and find the best deals. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.skyscanner.com/\\u0022\\u003eSkyscanner\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://hopper.com/\\u0022\\u003eHopper\\u003c/a\\u003e are two excellent iOS and Android apps that work similarly to narrow down the cheapest flights. You can also set up alerts for when prices drop, so you'll know when it's a good time to book.\\n\\nAnother way to save money on flights is to be strategic about how you book. For example, avoid booking round-trip tickets, which can often be more expensive than one-way tickets. Instead, consider booking separate one-way tickets for each leg of your trip. You can even split your outbound and inbound flights between different airlines! This can sometimes be more affordable and give you more flexibility if your plans change.\\n\\nIf you're flying internationally, looking for flights with layovers or stopovers can save you money. These can sometimes be more affordable than nonstop flights and allow you to explore another city on your way to your destination. For example, if you're flying from New York to Paris, you might look for a flight with a layover in London. This would allow you to visit two cities for the price of one. Famously, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.icelandair.com/flights/stopover/\\u0022\\u003eIcelandair\\u003c/a\\u003e allows you to specify a one to seven-day stopover in Iceland at no additional cost.\\n\\nWhen I travel, I like to avoid checking a bag if possible. Not only can it be costly, but it can also be a hassle. Instead, try to pack everything you need into one carry-on bag. If you're worried about not having enough room for gifts, consider giving gift cards or wait until you arrive to do your shopping. This will help you save space in your luggage and make your trip more enjoyable. I often travel in a pair of clothes on their last legs and then throw them out to make room for souvenirs and gifts from family and friends.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAccommodations\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nThere are also several ways to save money on accommodations. One option is to consider alternative accommodations, such as vacation rentals or home-sharing services. These can often be more affordable than traditional hotels and offer a more unique and local experience.\\n\\nVacation rentals, such as those offered on websites like \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.airbnb.com/\\u0022\\u003eAirbnb\\u003c/a\\u003e or \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vrbo.com/\\u0022\\u003eVRBO\\u003c/a\\u003e, can be an excellent option for holiday travel. These services connect travelers with locals willing to open their homes to guests. This can be a great way to save money on accommodations and it can also be a unique and memorable experience. Just be sure to research and read reviews before you book to ensure you're staying with a reputable host. Rentals like these can come equipped with all the amenities you need, such as a kitchen, laundry facilities, and sometimes even a pool or hot tub. This can be especially useful if you're traveling with a large group or with children, as it can help you save money on meals and entertainment.\\n\\nAnother way to save money on accommodations is to look for deals and discounts. Many hotels and vacation rentals offer special rates for holiday travel, so check their websites or call to ask about any deals they may offer. You can also use a site like \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.groupon.com/\\u0022\\u003eGroupon\\u003c/a\\u003e or \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.travelocity.com/\\u0022\\u003eTravelocity\\u003c/a\\u003e to find discounts.\\n\\nSometimes the best deals are found not online but by calling the hotel you'd like to visit. Direct booking this way can sometimes offer a good or better rate. Don't call the hotel's general number, though; do some sleuthing and find the location's local number. It never hurts to tell them you found a deal online and are wondering if they can match it or do better!\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eGeneral travel\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nTry carpooling with friends or family when traveling by car for the holidays! This reduces the cost of gas or electricity and allows multiple drivers to take turns behind the wheel, reducing the need for long breaks and allowing for a more efficient travel time. Additionally, carpooling can reduce the carbon footprint of your holiday travel.\\n\\nUse credit card rewards and loyalty programs to save on travel expenses. Many credit cards offer rewards for travel expenses, so it's worth checking to see if you can earn points or miles for your holiday travel. Also, loyalty programs for airlines, hotels, and car rental companies can offer discounts and perks, so it's worth signing up for these programs to save money on your trip. If the trip you're going on is starting to look expensive, it may be worth paying that high yearly fee for a credit card since you may eat the cost in the perks on one trip alone! Check out \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://thepointsguy.com/\\u0022\\u003eThe Points Guy\\u003c/a\\u003e for great advice on travel credit rewards cards.\\n\\nFinally, it's essential to be prepared for any unexpected expenses that may come up during your trip. This means setting a budget, sticking to it, and bringing extra cash or a credit card for emergencies. I like to include travel in my holiday budget as it keeps things simple and allows me to track changes yearly!\\n\\nOverall, holiday travel can be a fun and exciting experience, but it's important to plan ahead and avoid costly mistakes. By booking early, being flexible with your dates and destinations, and looking for deals and discounts, you can save money and have a stress-free holiday trip.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"row_background_color\":\"white\",\"_row_background_color\":\"field_5e2f5d26eaae3\",\"horizontal_rule\":\"0\",\"_horizontal_rule\":\"field_5989fb5734d75\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66b2646178322\"} /-->",

By setting intentions, you are taking control of your life and setting the stage for a successful and fulfilling year.\\n\\nAdditionally, intentions are more flexible and forgiving than resolutions, which can be strict and easy to break.

This can include organizing your bills (I keep the past few months’ worth), updating your will, and making sure you have copies of essential documents like your birth certificate and Social Security card should you need to prove your identity. I like to keep my important documents in a safe and secure location and audit them regularly. A fireproof lock box is a great place!\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eBe kind to yourself\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nLastly, being kind to yourself is vital as you work towards your financial goals. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you make mistakes or don’t achieve your goals immediately. If you beat yourself up over it, you're unlikely to stick to your goals over the long term. Remember that improving your financial health is a journey that takes time.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nMaking financial intentions is a great way to kick off the new year and start working towards your financial goals.

Overnight, somebody had tried to open two credit cards using my personal information, a clear indicator that I was a victim of identity theft. I only knew that something had happened because I had alerts from multiple credit monitoring services, notifying me that I had two new hard inquiries on my credit reports. Time is of the essence when it comes to fraud of any kind, so I immediately got to work trying to remedy the situation. Here’s how I was able to stop the fraudsters from getting further and repair my credit reports.\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eDon’t waste time on calls to vendors\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nThe first thing I did was to call the two lenders that had made hard inquiries on my credit reports to figure out what was going on. In my case, these two lenders were Capital One and Discover. Immediately I discovered that neither of their customer support lines was set up to handle a non-account holder trying to investigate potential fraud.\\n\\nWhen I finally made it through the long phone trees to speak with someone, they were confused as to what to do since I didn’t have any accounts on file with them. Explaining that I was the victim of identity theft and that I had hard inquiries from their companies on my credit reports didn’t help. In the end, I learned I would have to wait for the banks to open the credit lines and mail the cards to the fraudsters before I would be able to report the fraud to them.\\n\\nThis was incredibly frustrating and did not seem to do me much good. As you’ll see, if you read to the end, my fraud alerts were what saved me!\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eFreeze your credit\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nImmediately after speaking with Capital One and Discover and getting nowhere, I loaded up the websites for Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. Freezing your credit so that no new inquiries can be made is relatively easy after the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement\\u0022\\u003e2017 Equifax data breach\\u003c/a\\u003e, and while it would not help me with my current situation, it would prevent inquiries from being made in the future.\\n\\nBy the way, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.experian.com/\\u0022\\u003eExperian\\u003c/a\\u003e has two options for handling a situation like this. You can either freeze or lock your credit, or both. A credit freeze is the standard, federally required option, but if you want additional security, you can lock your credit by paying them a monthly fee of $4.99. I don’t think the extra level of protection is necessary and opted for the basic freeze.\\n\\u003ch2\\u003ePlace a fraud alert on your credit reports\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nThe next thing I did was to put a fraud alert on my credit reports. I learned that if you file a one-year fraud alert at one of the three credit bureaus, they are legally required to share that information with the other two. This is not the case with longer-term fraud alerts, or alerts as a result of active duty in the armed services. The TransUnion and Experian websites made it difficult to activate a one-year fraud alert, so I used the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.equifax.com/\\u0022\\u003eEquifax\\u003c/a\\u003e site. It took just a few minutes and showed up on my other credit reports within forty-eight hours.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eRemove hard inquiries from your credit reports\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nNow I wanted to get the hard inquiries off of my credit reports. This type of inquiry is bad for your credit and, given that it was the result of fraudulent activity, I didn’t want the inquiry hanging around for the next two years. The only problem is that the credit bureaus, though they proclaim to offer easy solutions for disputing accounts, can make removing inquiries a bear.\\n\\nTake \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.transunion.com/\\u0022\\u003eTransUnion\\u003c/a\\u003e for example. Their dispute center gives you quick and easy buttons to select which accounts you’d like to dispute. In order to dispute an inquiry though, you’ve got to call them. At least that is what their website says! I’ll save you some time though; their website is wrong. After going through thirty minutes of phone trees, an agent told me that I would have to mail them some documents via USPS in order to dispute a hard inquiry. The documents needed are a\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/\\u0022\\u003e Federal Trade Commission (FTC) identity theft report\\u003c/a\\u003e, a copy of your driver’s license, a copy of your credit report, a letter explaining the dispute that includes your credit report number, and a copy of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 605B. Save time by using the FTC template provided at the end of this article.\\n\\nInitially, I thought \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.equifax.com/\\u0022\\u003eEquifax\\u003c/a\\u003e was a little better because they did have the option to dispute a hard inquiry, but a few days later when my dispute was resolved with no changes to my credit report, I learned that actually, you have to mail them similar documents to those that TransUnion requires, including the same\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/\\u0022\\u003e Federal Trade Commission (FTC) identity theft report\\u003c/a\\u003e, a copy of your driver’s license, a copy of your social security card, a copy of your credit report, a letter explaining the dispute, and a copy of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 605B.\\n\\nFinally, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.experian.com/\\u0022\\u003eExperian\\u003c/a\\u003e. Could I dispute the inquiries online? No, that was not an option. However, I could call them during business hours and file disputes over the phone. I called (855) 414-6048 and was able to quickly file a dispute for both fraudulent inquiries and two addresses that were inaccurate. It took seventeen minutes and within two hours the inquiries were gone.\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eGood news\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nAfter all of this was done and I was beginning to calm down, I received a call from Capital One! Somehow the fraudulent account had not yet been opened and in the process of opening the account, the representative saw the fraud report I had placed on my credit reports. I confirmed that it was a case of fraud, and the account representative denied the application and submitted a letter of removal to the credit bureaus on my behalf. If I hadn’t taken action right away, the very moment I woke up, the fraudulent account would have been opened!\\n\\nFast forward to Monday, and I was the happy recipient of a phone call from Discover, asking me if the application for a credit card was legit or the reported fraud on my credit report. I immediately informed the representative that it was a case of fraud and to shut down the application.\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eProtecting yourself from fraud\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nBecoming a victim of identity theft is scary. Fortunately, fraud alerts can make it easy to act immediately when fraudulent activity has taken place, so if you are going to take any one action to protect yourself, I would suggest \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-fraud-alerts\\u0022\\u003esetting up alerts\\u003c/a\\u003e. To help make it easier for you to navigate the system, I’ve collected some resources I wish I had had on hand when this happened to me:\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eResources\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nFTC FRAUD REPORT: You can \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/\\u0022\\u003esubmit an FTC fraud report here\\u003c/a\\u003e. They direct you to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau where you can fill in the necessary information needed to alert authorities to your situation. This is an optional step but could help. The bureau will lend this report to the vendors who have pulled your credit to let them know your identity was stolen.\\n\\nIDENTITY THEFT REPORT: You’ll need to \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/\\u0022\\u003efile an FTC identity theft report\\u003c/a\\u003e here, which you can print off and include with your letter and other documents listed below. The process for reporting a hard inquiry was difficult to follow. Here is the path I took: Get Started \\u0026gt; Someone has my information and tried to use it, and I’m worried about identity theft. \\u0026gt; Debit or credit card information \\u0026gt; No \\u0026gt; Yes, someone used my information to make purchases or open accounts. \\u0026gt; Credit card accounts \\u0026gt; to open a fraudulent credit card account.\\n\\nIDENTITY THEFT LETTER TEMPLATE: The FTC has an identity theft letter template you can \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/Sample-Letters/identity-theft-credit-bureau\\u0022\\u003edownload here\\u003c/a\\u003e. Once you fill out this template and print it out, you will include it in the packet with the documents listed for each bureau below. The addresses for each bureau are included in the template. This website also includes a copy of the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://consumer.ftc.gov/system/files/consumer_ftc_gov/pdf/fcra-605b.pdf\\u0022\\u003eFair Credit Reporting Act Section 605B\\u003c/a\\u003e. I confirmed the addresses in the template were accurate, although the pieces of information the FTC suggested I include were different for each credit bureau, something I learned by speaking with them.

If you want to take full advantage of the powerful tools they offer, you’ll need to invest some time and effort. I’ve been using budgeting apps for many years, so here are some simple techniques you can use to get the most out of your favorite app.\\u003c!\\u002d\\u002dmore\\u002d\\u002d\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eSync it with all of your accounts\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nBudgeting apps work best when you connect to all of your accounts. That can include debit accounts, credit accounts, savings accounts, car loans, investments, and even your mortgage! The more sources you can add, the more complete your financial picture will be. This is especially useful if you have a few of the same type of account, such as multiple credit or debit cards. Syncing accounts is so important that I’ve switched banks/credit unions just because they had limited third-party sync options!\\n\\nMany apps can consolidate all of this information into a simple graph that shows your net worth over time. If you’re working hard to pay off debt or save, it can be extremely rewarding to see your net worth increase over time, even if the progress you are making seems slow.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCheck the app regularly\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nMany budgeting apps will advertise that they are the silver bullet to get your finances back on track. The reality is that while they can provide insight, they won’t do the hard work for you. Checking your app frequently—say two to three times a week—can make sure that you are keeping tabs on your spending habits.\\n\\nMost, if not all, budgeting apps use the merchant description to lump your transactions into the correct category. Checking the app at regular intervals will give you the opportunity to correct any errors in this automatic process.\\n\\nLet’s say that your grocery budget has $500 in it. Every time you go grocery shopping, your app adds that transaction to your grocery budget. One day, though, you get something else at the grocery store, like a beach towel for your upcoming vacation. That probably shouldn’t go in your grocery budget, but your app will automatically put it in that category based on the store. Manually correcting that inaccuracy will make sure that the insights you’re gathering from your budgeting app are correct.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eRefine your budgeting categories\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nWhen you set up a budgeting app for the first time, you’ll usually define your budget items or categories based on some presets that you can customize. Don’t feel like you’re limited to just those categories! The more you are able to refine your budgets over time, the better. My favorite category of all is my miscellaneous budget. So many random transactions just don’t fit in any other budgeting category!\\n\\nOne question I’ve heard a lot is, Should I have a few broad categories or get more specific in breaking down my spending? Personally, I like a larger number of smaller budgets. It makes it easier in the long run to see where all your money is going. Fewer, bigger budgets give you less accurate metrics, but they are easier to handle, especially if you are just starting out.\\n\\nExamples are always helpful when talking about budgeting, so here are my categories. Don’t be overwhelmed—I’ve been budgeting for years. If you start with a few categories, that’s great. You can slowly build up over time!\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eFood\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eGroceries\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eRestaurants\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eHousehold\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eMortgage\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eUtilities\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eTransportation\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eOther\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003ePets\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eHome Improvement\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eMISC\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003ePersonal Care\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eTechnology\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eClothing\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eKids\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eChildcare\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eMISC\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eInternet\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003ePersonal\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eEntertainment\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eFun\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eSubscriptions\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eWork Expenses\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eInsurance\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eHealthcare\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eTravel \\u0026amp; Vacation\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eGifts\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eLoans\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eExercise\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eTaxes\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eProperty Taxes\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAudit your subscriptions\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nWhether it’s companies trying to boost their reoccurring revenue for investors or hoping to convert more people to customers through the appeal of smaller monthly payments, everything seems to be turning into a subscription these days. Luckily, many budgeting apps have subscription trackers to help you keep tabs on things.\\n\\nFinding subscriptions is relatively easy for these tools. Does a similar transaction occur on a periodic basis at exactly the same time? It’s probably a subscription. That being said, it’s useful to regularly audit your transaction history for subscriptions, flag them as such, and then review your subscription list on a regular basis. I even include my mortgage as a subscription. It’s the same amount, every single month, at exactly the same time! This helps me budget month-to-month and gives me a sense of exactly how much money I have to play with that isn’t tied up in reoccurring transactions.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAdd your partner\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIf you’re in a long-term relationship and you manage finances with your partner, it can be useful to give them access to the app and work together to categorize transactions. Not only do you have a teammate who can categorize transactions and fix errors, but you can also plot a path for better financial health together. My wife and I do this and it is invaluable. If you’re interested in how we did it, I’ve written about \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/three-phases-to-managing-finances-in-a-relationship/\\u0022\\u003ehow we transitioned from separate accounts to joint accounts\\u003c/a\\u003e when we got married.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eBe flexible\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nLike dieting, if you go from zero to 60, it might be hard to stick with budgeting. Create a realistic budget and don’t beat yourself up if you go over it. Over time, you’ll get better at it and be able to optimize your spending and saving. Even budgeting experts can fall down! Learn from the mistake and move on. You can always make up for it the next month!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nWhatever budgeting app you use and however you use it, remember that it alone won’t solve your financial woes. All these apps can do is provide some transparency into your potentially opaque bank statements. It’s up to you to set your goals and boundaries, then use these apps to help keep you on track.

Just the thought of going into retirement with no or minimal debts gets me excited. Is paying off your mortgage before you retire right for everyone? The short answer is no. Here is why.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhen to pay off your mortgage early\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIf you’re trying to live off limited or no income—as most heading into retirement hope to—paying off your mortgage early can take a big chunk out of your monthly expenses. Not to mention the mental lift that you get not having to worry about that expense!\\n\\nYou might also want to pay off your mortgage early to save on interest payments and servicing fees. While you won’t be able to deduct the interest on your taxes anymore, you’ll likely still save money. You might not want to do this if it would cut into retirement funds that may continue to appreciate over time. Note that if you withdraw funds from your 401(k) before age 59.5 to pay off your mortgage, you’ll end up paying a \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/021015/how-much-are-taxes-ira-withdrawal.asp\\u0022\\u003e10% penalty\\u003c/a\\u003e on top of your standard income tax. It’s unlikely that the savings from getting rid of your mortgage will be greater than the penalty you pay for withdrawing funds early.\\n\\nIf your mortgage rate is higher than that of risk-free returns, paying off your mortgage can be as impactful as earning a risk-free return the equivalent of your interest rate. For example, if you are currently paying an interest rate of 5%, paying off your mortgage (and saving on interest) is like getting  tax-free 5% return! Like with most things in personal finance, it is all about finding a balance between the cost of a loan and the returns you might get with your funds stored elsewhere.\\n\\nIt may also make sense to pay off your mortgage if you do not have any high-interest debt, such as credit card debt. Since it is usually a good idea to \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/good-vs-bad-debt-whats-the-difference-when-managing-debt/\\u0022\\u003efocus on paying off your high-interest debt\\u003c/a\\u003e while still making payments on your low-interest debt, paying off your mortgage before your high-interest debt is typically a bad idea.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhen not to pay off your mortgage early\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIf you are behind in your retirement savings, saving in your retirement accounts should likely be your top priority. For example, funds that grow in your 401(k) aren’t taxed until you withdraw the money. If you aren’t sure if you are behind on your savings, find a local financial advisor to help you make a retirement plan.\\n\\nHow much liquid cash do you have saved outside of your investments and home? If it’s not much, it might not be the best idea to pay off your mortgage and become “house rich and cash poor.” It is always a good idea to have an emergency fund with enough cash available to cover the next three to six months of expenses. When in retirement, it’s usually a good idea to have even more than that set aside in cash. How much depends on your retirement income and any risk with your retirement funds. Plus, if you pay off your mortgage early and down the road find you need the money, it may be harder to \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/should-i-get-a-home-equity-loan-or-line-of-credit/\\u0022\\u003etap into the equity of your home\\u003c/a\\u003e later.\\n\\nHaving a diverse set of investments and assets is a good idea, so if paying off your mortgage puts most of your money into your house, it may not be the right thing for you. Speaking with a financial advisor can help you figure out if you’re too deep into one asset type or another.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nDeciding if you should pay off your mortgage early is a decision filled with variables unique to you. If you aren’t quite sure if you’re ready to do it yet, see if you can responsibly do two to three \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-to-reduce-debt-faster-with-principal-payments/\\u0022\\u003eextra principal payments\\u003c/a\\u003e every year.

It can seem hopeless if you are in this situation, but did you know that you can negotiate a lower interest rate on most credit cards? Here's how.\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eContact the credit card company you've been with the longest\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIt's best to start by calling the issuer of the credit card you have had the longest, especially if you have had a good relationship with that company. Longer, detailed credit histories mean something to credit card companies, so those you've been with for a while are much more likely to reduce your interest rate than your newer accounts.\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAsk for a temporary reduction\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIf you don't receive a drop in your interest rate at first, you can also ask for a temporary reduction. If your credit score has recently increased, use that to your advantage.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eTry again a few months later\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nAt the end of the day, credit card companies are run by people like you and me. Call back in a few months and ask again! It won't hurt your credit, especially if you continue to make payments. Card policies may have changed and the person on the other end might be more willing to reduce your rate, or perhaps your credit has improved enough over that short period to warrant a change.\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eKeep an eye out for promotions on your existing cards\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nGiven the current economic climate, some companies that offer rewards cards, like American Express or Chase, have recently started offering drastically lower temporary rate reductions in the 3-5% APR range. Usually, these promos are only found online and require you to opt in. Keep an eye on your digital banking and credit card portals for offers like these, and don't forget to read the fine print!\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eContact your other card issuers\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nStarting with the credit card accounts you've had the longest is the most likely way you'll reduce your overall interest rates since you have an existing history with them. Don't stop there though! If you have more than one card, keep going down through the list until you've contacted them all, then repeat the steps in a few months. Note that you'll see the biggest change to your personal bottom line by reducing the rate of your highest interest card or the card you carry the highest balance on.\\n\\nEven if you don't carry a balance on your cards, it is a good practice to regularly audit your financial tools—including your credit cards—to see if there are any opportunities to save money.

Nothing quite compares to the joy on a loved one’s face as they open a surprise present. Unfortunately giving gifts is not cheap, and it can be easy to lose track of your budget and slip into debt. If you’ve found yourself in this situation, here are some things you shouldn’t do when trying to eliminate holiday debt.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eDon't keep your old spending habits\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp style=\\u0022font-size: 18px;\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022color: #242424; background-color: white;\\u0022\\u003eOne of the hardest aspects of personal finance is being flexible enough to change your spending habits quickly. On one hand, it is very easy to spend more as you make more money or find yourself with a budget surplus, but going the other way is difficult. Once you’ve become used to a certain style of living or have lived with a spending habit for many years, adjusting to spending less is not easy.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp style=\\u0022font-size: 18px;\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022color: #242424; background-color: white;\\u0022\\u003eIf you’re trying to eliminate your holiday debt quickly, you’ll likely have to modify your spending habits for a period. Of course, if you’re already spending as little as you can, this tip may not be for you. There are plenty of people who are spending as little as they possibly can but still want to give substantial gifts during the holidays. Trying to spend less after the holidays is not feasible.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eDon't create an unpractical budget\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp style=\\u0022font-size: 18px;\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022color: #242424; background-color: white;\\u0022\\u003eIt can be easy to put together an ambitious budget that forecasts an extremely quick debt payoff. This strategy is counterproductive! Ambitious budgets seem like a good approach, but they can actually cause more damage than good. Here is why. You start out the month with an ambitious budget, saying to yourself that you’ll be better. As you start to slip, you become depressed that you have “failed” to reach your goal and abandon the budget. Not only are you now in a hard spot mentally, but it is also unlikely you’ll budget again in the near future.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp style=\\u0022font-size: 18px;\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022color: #242424; background-color: white;\\u0022\\u003eYou can avoid this trap by creating a budget that is realistic. Start with goals that seem way too easy, then enjoy the small win when you succeed.

If you’re able, stop spending on credit until you’ve paid off your balances. If you plan on using credit in the future for its various benefits, create a payment plan before you spend so you can avoid creating debt again.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eDon't try to pay off multiple debts at once\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp style=\\u0022font-size: 18px;\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022color: #242424; background-color: white;\\u0022\\u003eMost people try to pay off multiple debts all at once. Although this may sound counterintuitive, it is a better strategy to pay off your high-interest debt first. Let’s say you have a student loan with a 7% annual percentage yield (APY), a mortgage with a 3% APY, a credit card with a 15% APY, and a credit card with a 25% APY. If you pay as much as you can towards each of these accounts, you will find yourself paying more proportionally in interest to the credit card with 25% APY. Instead, focus on paying off that credit card while continuing to pay the minimum amounts required by your other lines of credit.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eDon't close your accounts once you've paid them off\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp style=\\u0022font-size: 18px;\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022color: #242424; background-color: white;\\u0022\\u003eClosing credit accounts feels amazing, I’ll be the first to admit. This can be especially true if you’ve struggled to pay off a balance. If you’re a little overzealous in closing accounts, it may be worth remembering that your credit score is not only based on how much you owe but how much credit you have available. So, pay off your accounts, but don’t necessarily close them.

Retirement accounts have decades of potential returns, so your small contributions now can end up making a real impact. For example, \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.officialdata.org/us/stocks/s-p-500/2000\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022color: #242424; background-color: white;\\u0022\\u003ethe S\\u0026amp;P 500 grew 371.02% from the beginning of 2000 to the beginning of 2021\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022color: #242424; background-color: white;\\u0022\\u003e.

It can be easy to continue life as normal without opening your budget or your digital banking app and seeing your real balances.

Working past that mental roadblock is extremely hard, and if you have already passed it, give yourself a pat on the back.\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eDon’t check social media obsessively\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp style=\\u0022font-size: 18px;\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\u0022color: #; background-color: white;\\u0022\\u003eThis might seem like an odd recommendation given the topic of this blog, but it has real relevance. Social media gives us a tailored, optimistic view of the lives of others. It is a reality distortion machine and has been proven to give people an unhealthy view of themselves in the world. If you check social media obsessively, you may feel like you’re worse off in several different ways compared to reality. Then paid advertising or collaborations with influencers can sneak into your mind, making you think (sometimes without you realizing it) that you need a product to feel good, be good, etc….

While my personal finances haven’t changed much in the past decade, what has changed is the cost of living with an electric car. To illustrate the economics of electric vehicles in 2021, here is how I purchased my very first electric car and how you just might be able to do the same.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp style=\\u0022text-align: left;\\u0022\\u003eIn May of this year, I took my wife’s car and my car to the local mechanic for some regularly scheduled maintenance. We both owned Subaru Crosstreks—one from 2014 with 85,000 miles and one from 2015 with 69,000 miles. I walked away from those two car appointments with a total bill of over $4,000*. This was a shocking number, and it wasn’t the first time I’d gotten a bill so high for maintenance. In the past few years, we’ve driven less than 10,000 miles a year on your average Vermont roads. Based on my limited knowledge, my maintenance bill should not have been as high as it was. Long story short, after accounting for the cost of gas, insurance, and the ever-increasing maintenance, I was completely overwhelmed with the reality of keeping the cars running.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp style=\\u0022text-align: left;\\u0022\\u003eIn an act of desperation—combined with a healthy dose of desire to own an electric car—I started doing some research about what it would cost to replace our vehicles. With my wife taking a year off to raise our son full-time at home, I knew we could drop down to one car for a while, which would certainly help with the cost.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eDetermining affordability\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIt took some careful calculations to determine whether switching from our gas vehicles to an electric car would make financial sense. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/549330/Car%20Buying%20101/EV%20Blog%20Spreadsheet%20(Final).xlsx\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eUse this spreadsheet\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e to follow along with the calculations described below.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSTEP ONE: ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF YOUR CURRENT CAR(S)\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nThe first thing I did was get an estimate for our current cars. I turned to Kelly Blue Book, the industry standard for estimating vehicle value, and came away with a range of numbers. For both of our Subarus, I could expect a total of anywhere between $23,000 and $28,000 if I negotiated a trade-in.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSTEP TWO: CALCULATE THE INTEREST OF EXISTING NON-VEHICLE LOAN(S)\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nMy wife and I completed a large weatherization project on our house the year before and had seventy-two months remaining on our $17,000 loan. At a 5.65% interest rate, we were anticipating the loan to cost us roughly $3,000 in interest over the remaining months. If I could pay off that loan using the proceeds from selling our Subarus and get a car lease or loan with a much lower rate, we’d be saving a ton of money over a three-year period, which I chose because it is the standard leasing period of a new car. The money we saved could then go toward the new vehicle. You can find your own loan cost from interest by using step two in the provided spreadsheet.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSTEP THREE: ESTIMATE ANNUAL AND THREE-YEAR COST OF EXISTING CAR(S)\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nThe next thing I did was estimate the yearly cost of owning the Subarus. I reviewed our financial records from the past few years to estimate how much gas and repairs cost over the three-year period. The total came to roughly $15,000.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSTEP FOUR: CALCULATE POTENTIAL THREE-YEAR SAVINGS ACHIEVED BY SELLING CAR\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nTaking these three pieces of information, I projected that my wife and I would save roughly $16,541.80 over three years if we sold both of our Subarus and paid off the weatherization loan. I calculated this number by adding the projected three-year cost of keeping our Subarus (step two) to three years of interest payments on our weatherization loan (step three).\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSTEPS FIVE: CALCULATE BALANCE AFTER SELLING CAR(S) AND PAYING OFF LOANS\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nIn order for this plan of mine to work successfully, I needed to pay off the existing weatherization loan we had. Since I don’t have a big chunk of cash just sitting around, I needed to use some of the proceeds from selling our cars to pay off the loan. What was left over, I could either save or invest, or I could use as part of the down payment on the new car. I determined this amount by subtracting the three-year loan interest amount (step two) from the estimated trade-in/sale value of our vehicles (step one).\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSTEP SIX: CALCULATE MONTHLY AND THREE-YEAR COST OF NEW CAR\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nCalculate the monthly cost of the new vehicle to determine how much you will pay each month and to see how much the vehicle will cost you over the course of three months. If you’re using the spreadsheet included with this blog, you can use the calculations in step five to plug into your preferred automaker's lease or loan calculator to generate the numbers you’ll need in this step. This will allow you to compare your current expenses to potential future expenses. The number you come to here may appear higher than your current expenses, but hold onto your hat because…\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSTEP SEVEN: APPLY INCENTIVES\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nHere’s where things get really interesting! Electric vehicles have very little maintenance, electricity is relatively cheap compared to gas, and there are \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.driveelectricvt.com/incentives\\u0022\\u003emultiple incentives available from utilities, state governments, and the federal government\\u003c/a\\u003e. If I bought an electric vehicle from a manufacturer with all the incentives available, I’d have $9,000 in my pocket from incentives alone after purchase.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSTEP EIGHT: DETERMINE THE TOTAL THREE-YEAR COST OF THE NEW VEHICLE AFTER INCENTIVES\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nIf the dealership gave good trade-in values for our Subarus, we’d use the funds to pay off our weatherization loan and lease the Mach-E for an out-of-pocket cost of $7,812 over the next three years, including incentives. I reached this number by subtracting the incentives calculated in step seven from the three-year cost of the new vehicle after the down payment in step six.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eFinding the right vehicle\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nArmed with all this information, my wife and I started looking for an electric vehicle to fit our needs and budget. It was important to us that we have a family vehicle that could reliably take us to Boston multiple times a year in all weather conditions, go on the occasional long-distance road trip, get up the steep hill at my parent’s house in the winter, and look good.\\n\\nAt the time, there were only three options that fit all these criteria. The Tesla Model Y, the Ford Mustang Mach-E, and the VW ID.4. After watching a great many reviews, we settled on the Mustang Mach-E, something I never thought I’d say. Our second choice was the Volkswagen ID.4, but the all-wheel-drive version won’t be available till mid-2022 so that immediately disqualified it. The Tesla Model Y was last on our list, even though it technically has the best infrastructure and longest range of the three cars. From everything I’d seen and read, the build quality of most Tesla vehicles appears to be lacking. Being persnickety about things like that, I wasn’t willing to buy a Tesla even for its aforementioned benefits.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eSTEP NINE: CALCULATE NET SAVINGS AFTER THREE YEARS\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nThe cost to lease a Mach-E on the Ford Options Plan—a payment plan that resembles a loan more than a lease—fit into the budget I mentioned early in this piece. If I was able to finagle the dealership to offer me the higher range of my Kelly Blue Book estimated trade-in values, we’d be able to afford the standard range, eAWD Mach-E.\\n\\nHere is how the math works out. Based on the estimated interest on the weatherization loan over the next three years combined with the cost to run the Subarus during that same period ($16,541.80), we could save roughly $8,729.8 ($16,541.80 - $7,812) and get ourselves a brand-new electric vehicle, not including the savings on gas. You can find this number for yourself by taking the results from step four and subtracting the price of your new vehicle over three years (step eight).\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eA note on tax incentives\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIt’s worth mentioning that in order to make this plan work within our budget, we are relying on a $7,500 EV tax credit, which is included in the incentives I mentioned in step seven. This is important because while we started leasing the car in May 2021, we won’t get the tax credit until early 2022. That may make a plan like this inaccessible to someone that does not have the means to wait for a check from the IRS. This particular tax credit is also non-refundable, so unless you owe $7,500 or more, you won’t see the full credit amount.\\n\\nThe monthly cost of our car is also quite high compared to most traditional leases. This is partly due to the way Ford structures the Ford Options Plan and partly due to the fact that we are paying a lease on the full value of the car, not the value of the car after incentives. That means we will receive a big lump of cash in early 2022, but still need to be able to stomach the high monthly payment. This, like the previously mentioned downside to the tax credit, can make electric vehicles out of reach for those with limited monthly cash flow.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow it has worked out\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nSo how has it worked out in practice? My wife and I absolutely love our new car. We initially thought its 211-mile range would be restricting, but in practice, we have never once had to worry about charging. Because electric vehicles are so efficient, we can go pretty much anywhere in Vermont (there and back). When we drive to Boston, we stop for about 15 minutes for a bathroom and food break, and we plug in during that period. By the time we get back to the car, the battery is nearly full.\\n\\nFinding charging stations on a road trip is a breeze. The car automatically notifies you if you will soon be out of range of the nearest charger to complete your journey, and if you use the built-in navigation, the car automatically adds chargers to your trip based on charging speed, availability, and your current range. That means all you have to do is plug in your final destination and the car will find the quickest route to your destination, including charging!\\n\\nThe other benefits of an electric car are well worth the mindset change. With no engine, the car is safer in front impact collisions, giving us more peace of mind with our son in the back seat. Because the electric motors slow down the car, we only need to use the brakes in emergency situations and won’t have to worry about replacing brakes either. Some electric vehicles have gone well over 100,000 miles before needing new pads and rotors! Plus, we’ve only seen our electricity bill go up $15 a month as a result of charging the car at home. This is a far cry from the nearly $150 a month we were paying for gas. The rare occasions that we charge on the road are either free, complimentary from the automaker, or just under the typical cost to fill up on gas.\\n\\nAnd they are so quiet! I’ve sat in cars from luxury brands that aren’t as quiet as this one. And did I mention that there are no gears? You no longer have to deal with an automatic transmission that needs to hunt for gears on a hill or slows down as you try to merge onto a highway.\\n\\nDoes it feel weird having a red electric Mustang with four doors and also having saved money? 100%. It doesn’t even feel possible to me, but the math works out. I feel as though I have to explain to everyone who sees it that I don’t actually make a lot and this vehicle wasn’t an extravagant purchase.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nElectric cars are here, and they are amazing. Still hesitant about making the jump? \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.driveelectricvt.com/\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eDrive Electric of Vermont\\u003c/a\\u003e hosts EV days where you can chat with owners and experience the cars for yourself.

Although the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supply-chain-issues-cargo-ships-store-shelves/\\u0022\\u003esupply chain logjam\\u003c/a\\u003e means that everything from computer chips to \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/11/17/holiday-pies-climate-change/\\u0022\\u003epies\\u003c/a\\u003e from local bakeries is delayed by weeks or even months, we’ve got some ideas for how you can still find the perfect gift in time for the holidays.\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e\\n1. be flexible\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nThe earlier you start shopping for this year’s gifts, the better. This gives you flexibility and some control over the shipping delays. Plus, if you can be flexible with the items on your list, you may be able to find alternatives to gifts you had your heart set on.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e2. try multiple businesses\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nThis may seem like a no-brainer, but different stores have vastly different inventories. If one doesn’t have the item that you are looking for, it is possible that another store in your area has one in stock. On multiple occasions, I have found the gift I was looking for at a locally operated store when the big box store in the same town said they were out of stock. As an example, I was looking for a set of AirPods to give my mother, but Best Buy, Apple, Walmart, and Amazon all were out of stock or had extremely long wait times. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://shop.smalldog.com/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eSmall Dog Electronics\\u003c/a\\u003e in Burlington, on the other hand, had multiple sets available for same-day pickup!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e3. check online and in-store\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nMany retailers have different inventory in store compared to what they list online. They do this to preserve a good customer experience for someone walking into their storefronts expecting to buy something right away! In addition, some businesses limit how many hot items they sell daily so that every morning there are some products in stock. So, if you’re looking for something that appears to be sold out online, head to a storefront near you right when they open!\\n\\nPro tip: Stores like Target, Walmart, and Best Buy tell you online if they might have items at your local store, so check there first and save yourself a trip!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e4. get a gift card\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIf your heart is set on getting a very particular gift that is out of stock everywhere you’ve looked, don’t forget you can get a gift card in the exact amount of the product and gift that instead. While it isn’t necessarily as special as giving the gift itself, the recipient can use it however they wish. This has the added benefit of the recipient can use the gift card for something else they want if they don’t want to wait for an item that won’t be available soon.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e5. check one of these stores\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/18/business/holiday-shopping-walmart-target-supply-chain/index.html\\u0022\\u003eAccording to CNN\\u003c/a\\u003e, Walmart, Target, and Home Depot have spent significant time building up stock over the past few months and have also chartered their own vessels to bring goods made around the world to U.S. storefronts. If you’re having trouble finding a particular gift at a locally owned and operated store, it might be worth checking out one of these retailers.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e6. try social media to find current-generation gaming consoles\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIf you’re trying to find an Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, or Nintendo Switch, you’re likely out of luck. Restocks of these items are few and far between, even a year after their initial releases, and there is no stock available in stores. However, if you’re a Twitter user and fast on your feet, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://twitter.com/ps5stockalerts\\u0022\\u003efollow this account\\u003c/a\\u003e for stock drops. You can turn on notifications to get instant updates. These drops are often only in stock for less than a minute, but if you are fast you may be able to grab one!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e7. gift an experience\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIf you can’t find a consumer good from your shopping list, consider gifting something else entirely, like part of a future vacation or a fancy dinner at a nearby restaurant. Gifting an experience means you can avoid the supply chain logjam entirely. Plus, many people consider experiences to be more rewarding and valuable in the long term. You may not remember that sweatshirt you received a few years ago, but rest assured you’ll remember that weekend getaway or that incredible, all expenses paid dinner at \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.henofthewood.com/\\u0022\\u003eHen of the Wood\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nIf after all of this you still can’t seem to find the right gift in stock, remember that the holidays are all about being with the people you love.

Coverage of the much-needed rescue package focused on the increased stimulus payments, but the child tax credit had some significant changes as well. Namely, some families will begin to receive advanced payments starting July 15 (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/advance-child-tax-credit-payments-in-2021\\u0022\\u003eIRS\\u003c/a\\u003e). Here’s everything you need to know about the child tax credit in 2021!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow much will you receive?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nFamilies with a dependent child age 17 or younger will receive a $3,000 refundable tax credit per child. If your dependent children are under the age of 6 on December 31, 2021, you’ll receive a total of $3,600 for each of them.\\n\\nLike the stimulus payments before them, the income threshold for the full payment is $75,000 for single filers; $150,000 for joint filers, widows, and widowers; and $112,500 for heads of household. If your modified adjusted gross income is higher than that, you’ll receive a diminishing payment based on how much you make over the threshold (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/qualify-child-child-care-tax-credit\\u0022\\u003eNerdwallet\\u003c/a\\u003e).\\n\\nThis type of tax credit—a refundable tax credit—guarantees that you’ll receive the full amount. Refundable tax credits are applied first to any owed tax and you get a refund if your total credit is greater than what you owe (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/tax-deductions-and-credits/what-is-the-difference-between-a-refundable-and-a-nonrefundable-credit/L5ZBHTL5Y\\u0022\\u003eTurboTax\\u003c/a\\u003e). It is treated the same way that tax payments are treated through your W-4 withholding—if you pay more than you owe, you’d receive some money as a refund. This type of credit is different from a nonrefundable credit, which cannot reduce your tax liability beyond $0—you won’t receive extra money from a nonrefundable credit beyond what is needed to cover your existing tax liability.\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAre you eligible?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nThankfully you don’t have to guess if you’ll be eligible! The IRS has \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://apps.irs.gov/app/ctceligible/\\u0022\\u003ea tool on its website\\u003c/a\\u003e to check your eligibility. It takes just a few minutes and can provide you with a definitive answer. Given the wide array of possible scenarios, we will not attempt to describe every situation here.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow do i enroll in advance payments?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIf your dependent child (or children) will be under the age of 18 on December 31, 2021 and you filed a 2019 or 2020 tax return claiming your child tax credit, you’ll be automatically enrolled to receive advanced payments starting this July! You’ll also be automatically enrolled if you used the Economic Impact Payment tool on the IRS website to receive your stimulus check(s) (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/advance-child-tax-credit-payments-in-2021\\u0022\\u003eIRS\\u003c/a\\u003e). In both these scenarios, no additional input is required from you to begin receiving advanced payments. If you aren’t required to file a tax return and are wondering how to get your payment, you can \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/child-tax-credit-non-filer-sign-up-tool\\u0022\\u003eenter your information here\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\n\\nIf you are automatically enrolled, you’ll receive half of your tax credit in installments every month starting on July 15 (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/advance-child-tax-credit-payments-in-2021\\u0022\\u003eIRS\\u003c/a\\u003e). The IRS will pay half of the total credit amount this way with the rest claimed on your 2021 income tax return when you file in 2022.\\n\\nIn some rare cases, you may have to return part of your child tax credit if you receive advanced payments. Possible reasons include income increases in 2021 that push you beyond the full payment threshold or a change of custody of dependents (\\u003ca href=\\u0022http://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/why-some-families-may-have-to-repay-2021-child-tax-credit-payments.html\\u0022\\u003eCNBC\\u003c/a\\u003e). If you think any of these situations apply to you, it may be worth stopping advanced payments so you don’t have a surprising tax bill in 2022.\\n\\nYou can check to see if you’re automatically enrolled, stop your advance payments, or update your bank account information \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/child-tax-credit-update-portal\\u0022\\u003eon the IRS website\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"row_background_color\":\"white\",\"_row_background_color\":\"field_5e2f5d26eaae3\",\"horizontal_rule\":\"0\",\"_horizontal_rule\":\"field_5989fb5734d75\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66b2646178322\"} /-->",

Robinhood is a new breed of commission-free investment app that allows anyone to trade stocks and funds through a simple mobile app that rewards investments with confetti and other fun graphics. The company recently came under increased scrutiny, for creating a user experience that encourages risky behavior, when a twenty-year-old user committed suicide because he thought he had lost $730,000 dollars (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alex-kearns-robinhood-trader-suicide-wrongful-death-suit/\\u0022\\u003eCBS News\\u003c/a\\u003e). While apps like Robinhood provide an innovative and exciting new way for anyone to become an active investor, they are also causing significant harm to unseasoned investors who are unaware of the dangers of risky investment tactics. Here are a few things to keep in mind before you dip your toe into the market and risk gambling away your money.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAre you investing or gambling?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nSome investment apps, like Robinhood, use game design to encourage you to spend more time investing. In fact, studies have shown that Robinhood users are especially likely to make risky trades and trade more often (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html\\u0022\\u003eNYTimes\\u003c/a\\u003e). Some examples of this encouragement include regular push notifications of price changes, “free” stock you can receive during app sign-up, and cheerful design elements that reward the trades you make.\\n\\nGambling addiction experts have long spoken out about aspects of Robinhood’s design, but while some change has been made for the better, the problem still exists (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/gambling-addiction-experts-see-familiar-aspects-robinhood-app-n1256213\\u0022\\u003eNBC News\\u003c/a\\u003e). Some attribute the staggering financial loss to these designs that encourage regular and rapid trading of stocks, including some speculative options. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html\\u0022\\u003eOne New York Times article\\u003c/a\\u003e refers to an app user named Mr. Dobatse who “said he had been charmed by Robinhood’s one-click trading, easy access to complex investment products, and features like falling confetti and emoji-filled phone notifications that made it feel like a game.”\\n\\nBehavioral nudges and pushes are a familiar Silicon Valley strategy for driving engagement, but that strategy goes against the most recommended financial advice, which prioritizes long-term investments over the high risk of short-term alternatives.\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow frequent trading can reduce the potential for long-term gains\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nFinancial advisors often recommend that their clients make investments that sit in the market for a long time, rather than try to take small gains with short-term investment. This is because the overall market trends upwards, but in any given day, week, month, or year can experience dramatic swings. Take the S\\u0026amp;P 500 (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://g.co/finance/.INX:INDEXSP?window=5Y\\u0022\\u003eGoogle and Yahoo Finance\\u003c/a\\u003e). Between February and March of 2020, the S\\u0026amp;P 500 dropped over 30%. A retail investor (as opposed to a professional investor) buying in early February and selling in mid-March, out of fear of a continued drop in the market value of their investments, would have lost a lot of money because they would have experienced the drop but would not have benefited from the rise in values that followed. Compare that period of time to the five-year overall trend of the S\\u0026amp;P 500, which is up nearly 100%! This is precisely why financial advisors recommend against watching the markets. Some financial experts consider day trading itself to be akin to gambling, especially for the retail investor (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.netflix.com/title/81345769\\u0022\\u003eMoney Explained\\u003c/a\\u003e).\\n\\nHow does this tie into Robinhood and other apps? As we’ve seen already, trading apps encourage frequent engagement in the stock market through design and constant nudges. This means retail investors who do not have the expertise of more seasoned traders are trading more frequently. The more frequent you trade, the higher your risk!\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHave you heard of meme stocks?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n2020 saw the volatile rise and fall of GameStop and AMC stock after retail investors flooded the market to attempt to squeeze out \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-careers/09/private-equity.asp\\u0022\\u003eprivate-equity firms\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp\\u0022\\u003ehedge funds\\u003c/a\\u003e from their short positions by using investment apps like Robinhood in great numbers (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/why-everybody-obsessed-gamestop/617857/\\u0022\\u003eThe Atlantic\\u003c/a\\u003e). These stocks, driven by the subreddit WallStreetBets, Elon Musk, and other popular social media figures have earned the nickname “Meme Stocks” thanks to the fact that the price per share is not being driven by underlying value, but instead by a flood of retail investors trying to pump up a stock to unrealistic levels (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/06/02/not-just-amc-these-are-the-meme-stocks-reddit-traders-are-pumping-again-as-experts-urge-extreme-caution/?sh=5e2bce6455fc\\u0022\\u003eForbes\\u003c/a\\u003e). Although all investing is inherently risky, putting money into a meme stock is far more so because there can be 30% or more fluctuations up or down based on a few people on Twitter or Reddit.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow does one pick an investment app?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nNot all investment apps play the same game as Robinhood. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://public.com/\\u0022\\u003ePublic\\u003c/a\\u003e, a competitor to Robinhood, was founded with some investor protections in mind and does not allow day trading. After the rental company Hertz declared bankruptcy in 2020, its stock soared, defying all logic. For some reason, retail investors thought that buying stock in a company that had just declared bankruptcy was akin to buying at the lowest price. Public pulled the stock from its platform so that investors were protected (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-06-08/bankrupt-stock-hertz\\u0022\\u003eLATimes\\u003c/a\\u003e). They also have placed high-risk warnings on stocks that are spiking without any substantial value behind them.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhat's the final word?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nInvestment apps have a huge opportunity to democratize the markets by putting easy-to-use financial tools into the hands of the general public. The rise of meme stocks is just one example of retail investors trying to play the same games that institutional investors have been playing for decades.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nIf you choose to dabble in investing with one of these apps, consider the risks first and be conscious of what app you choose. If you think you’re ready to invest, it’s often best and safest to talk with a financial advisor who can assess your risk level and design an investment strategy that works for you.\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-author-section\\u0022\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"row_background_color\":\"white\",\"_row_background_color\":\"field_5e2f5d26eaae3\",\"horizontal_rule\":\"0\",\"_horizontal_rule\":\"field_5989fb5734d75\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66b2646178322\"} /-->",

We’ve invested in weatherization, cold climate heat pumps, a heat pump hot water heater, and other energy efficiency upgrades with support from a local lender. After we completed these upgrades last year, I’ve been curiously exploring what else we could modify for further efficiency. Enter the heat pump dryer!\\n\\nOur 1,300-square-foot house has three different kinds of “fuel” delivered on a regular basis. With more and more of our house running off electricity and putting aside the oil furnace, I’m left with a relatively minimal propane bill that I’d like to eliminate.\\n\\nOther than our range, the appliance that consumes the most propane is the dryer!\\n\\nNaturally, I’ve been researching new dryer technology. Let me introduce you to the hottest (pun intended) dryer technology around: the heat pump dryer! I first stumbled across this technology in an article from \\u003cem\\u003eThe New York Times\\u003c/em\\u003e’ Wirecutter (a recommendation website where experts review and test all kinds of products) titled, “\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-washer-and-dryer/\\u0022\\u003eThe Best Washing Machines (and Their Matching Dryers)\\u003c/a\\u003e.” One of their picks is the Miele T1, a $1,200 dryer that uses heat pump technology to significantly reduce power consumption and costs only a few hundred dollars more than traditional models.\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe hottest dryer technology around\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nWhat makes a heat pump dryer so amazing? Firstly, it can be plugged into any standard 120-volt outlet. Don’t have a 30-amp dryer plug because you live in a small space, want to put the dryer somewhere else, or are converting from gas? No problem! A standard household plug will provide all the power you need.\\n\\nBecause heat pump dryers are so efficient, they also consume much less energy and don’t require the kind of electrical supply that a traditional electric dryer would need. Energy Star reports that heat pump dryers \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.energystar.gov/products/heat_pump_dryer\\u0022\\u003euse at least 28% less electricity\\u003c/a\\u003e compared to standard dryers. According to several heat pump dryer owners on the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/welcome-to-the-forum/trying-to-decide-bw-gas-dryer-vs-heat-pump-dryer/\\u0022\\u003eMr. Money Mustache forum\\u003c/a\\u003e, a standard heat pump dryer uses about half of the electricity per load of a traditional machine.\\n\\nSecondly, a heat pump dryer is entirely self-contained. Because of the way heat pumps work, the machine cycles all the air through the system and doesn’t require a vent to the outdoors! This is beneficial for numerous reasons. You don’t have to punch a hole in the insulation of your house or can reduce the number of holes in your house for greater efficiency and comfort. You’re also able to put your dryer anywhere, including in a closet with no access to the outside!\\n\\nAll you need for this dryer is somewhere to send the condensation from the heat exchanger in the base of the unit, like a floor drain or a sink. You don’t even need a plumber to install it and there is no outside unit.\\n\\nFinally, heat pump dryers are less aggressive on clothes, are easier to remove lint from and clean, and are advertised to have a long appliance lifespan. The Miele W1, the counterpart washing machine to the T1 I mentioned above, received a good review by Wirecutter, which had this to say:\\n\\n\\u003cem\\u003eOnly a few brands make durable washers anymore, and some of those heavy-duty machines are essentially laundromat washers—often loud, rough on fabric, inefficient, and not so great at cleaning. The Miele W1 is the opposite of all those things and is still somehow built to last for 20 years.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow a heat pump dryer works\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nThe dryer works by feeding hot, dry air into the clothes drum where your wet laundry is being tossed. That air picks up the moisture in the clothes and then passes the now warm, humid air over a set of cold coils in the base of the machine. These coils are referred to as the heat exchanger.\\n\\nThe rapid cooling of the air over the cold coils creates condensation, which drips out down a drain hose into a nearby sink, floor drain, or pipe. As the hot, moist air blows over these coils, it simultaneously begins to warm up contained liquid in the coils, called refrigerant. It’s called refrigerant not because it is always cold, but because it is very efficient at transferring heat!\\n\\nThe now warm refrigerant is passed to a compressor, which superheats it. The colder, dry air created in the previous step passes through this next set of extremely hot coils. The cold air picks up heat from the coils, and in turn, cools the refrigerant. The hot, dry air now is passed into the drum of the machine and the cycle begins again. It is this process of moving heat and moisture around using refrigerant, a compressor, and coils that makes the machine so efficient and is what gives it its name.\\n\\n(Want to learn more about how heat pumps work? This \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeN-h6opueM\\u0022\\u003eshort, free video from Ask This Old House\\u003c/a\\u003e provides a wealth of visual aids so that you can easily understand what makes these machines so incredible.)\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe downsides\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nOn the other hand, heat pump dryers do dry slower than their standard counterparts and usually don’t come in the massive drum sizes that many 2021 models from LG and Samsung advertise. As a result, they may not be the right fit for large families.\\n\\nTo recap, heat pump dryers are more efficient, can use a standard outlet, don’t require a vent, and you don’t have to pay a premium to access this futuristic technology. What’s more, you can get up to \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.efficiencyvermont.com/rebates/list/clothes-dryers\\u0022\\u003e$400 cash back from Efficiency Vermont\\u003c/a\\u003e for an Energy Star certified heat pump clothes dryer and up to an additional $200 from some electricity providers. If you need a new dryer, a heat pump dryer feels like a no-brainer to me!\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"row_background_color\":\"white\",\"_row_background_color\":\"field_5e2f5d26eaae3\",\"horizontal_rule\":\"0\",\"_horizontal_rule\":\"field_5989fb5734d75\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66b2646178322\"} /-->",

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you plan your post-COVID adventures out in the world.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhen not to travel\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends waiting to travel until you are fully vaccinated. For the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, that means two weeks after your second shot. For the Johnson \\u0026amp; Johnson vaccine, that is two weeks after your single dose. If you haven’t been vaccinated yet but have to travel for unavoidable circumstances, see CDC recommendations for traveling \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html\\u0022\\u003edomestically\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html\\u0022\\u003einternationally\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\n\\nEven if you have been fully vaccinated, you should not travel with symptoms of COVID-19. You also should not travel if you think you might have been exposed to COVID-19.

Get a quality face mask or two and keep one on as much as possible! I personally hope that COVID-19 has helped reduce the stigma of wearing a mask so that everyone will take preventative measures even if they only have a common cold.\\n\\nWhen you travel, touching a lot of surfaces is unavoidable. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/surface-transmission.html\\u0022\\u003eAccording to the CDC\\u003c/a\\u003e, “It is possible for people to be infected through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects…, but the risk is generally considered to be low.” The most important thing you can do to protect yourself from this low-risk transmission is to wash your hands frequently and try to reduce contact in highly trafficked areas.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow to overcome a fear of traveling\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2020/11/10/post-covid-19-travel-41-people-worldwide-expect-to-travel-less-by-any-meansnew-research/?sh=203c66b35f67\\u0022\\u003eForbes reported\\u003c/a\\u003e that 41% of individuals are planning to travel much less after COVID-19.

Often the road less traveled offers the most exquisite experiences and you’ll be far away from the big crowds of eager post-COVID travelers! A unique travel experience doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg, either. Think hiking in Canada or kayaking in Portland, Oregon!\\n\\nNow more than ever might be a wise time to purchase trip cancellation insurance. Due to COVID-19, the unpredictable nature of travel basically necessitates it! Last year, many people who opted out of trip cancellation insurance were unable to get refunds for trips they had booked prior to the pandemic. Many credit cards offer some level of protection, but if the vendor you purchase your tickets from offers a relatively affordable insurance option, it might be worth it! Trip cancellation insurance should cost \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.forbes.com/advisor/travel-insurance/best-cancel-for-any-reason-travel-insurance/#:~:text=Keep%20in%20mind%2C%20travel%20insurance,additional%20%24200%20for%20CFAR%20coverage.\\u0022\\u003eno more than between 5% and 10% of your total trip cost\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\n\\nNote that trip cancellation insurance is different from travel protection, which offers additional benefits like rental car damage, flight delays, lost luggage, and medical expenses.

What was once a niche area of the internet has become an integral part of most peoples’ days. The enormous reach of these platforms means scammers can now access a broader population than ever before. While the companies behind your favorite social media networks are hard at work to reduce scams, they cannot keep up with the sheer volume and cunning of some fraudsters. Here are a few things you can do to keep yourself safe.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eFacebook\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nFacebook is by far the largest social network with 1.84 billion daily active users across the world. Since scammers usually try to target the largest group of people possible to increase their likelihood of success, Facebook is where scams are most prevalent on social media. The most common type of scam involves a very similar strategy to \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/how-to-avoid-common-types-of-fraud-phishing-vishing-and-smishing\\u0022\\u003ephishing\\u003c/a\\u003e. A scammer will message their target through a fake Facebook profile, either posing as a friend or as a business and request that the target click a link to share some personal information. Luckily, Facebook provides a number of tools and systems that are designed to help you and limit what fraudulent accounts can do.\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eBusiness pages are limited in their interactions and cannot submit friend requests through Facebook. Only personal profiles can submit friend requests. If an account that looks like a business sends you a friend request, you’re likely a target for a scam.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eWhile businesses on Facebook can reach out to the public through group invites or invitations to like a page, they cannot send you a direct message unless you have previously interacted with that business by commenting on a post or by messaging the page directly. Generally speaking, if you receive a Facebook message from someone you have not interacted with recently, it may be a scam.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eTwo types of Facebook pages exist: verified and unverified pages. Some pages may have a blue checkmark to signify their legitimacy, but that tool is only given to a select few pages. For the vast majority of pages, you can check to see if Facebook has conducted a notarized identity confirmation process by finding the Page Transparency section of a Facebook Page. Because it can appear in different places depending on how you access the page, check out \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.facebook.com/help/323314944866264\\u0022\\u003ethis support article\\u003c/a\\u003e on where to find Page Transparency.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eMessages and posts that ask you to click a link to provide personal information to collect a prize are most likely scams, especially if they are unsolicited. Most authentic giveaways only require an address and name to send you your winnings. Any person or page that asks you for a credit card number or Social Security number is almost certainly trying to scam you.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\nIf you receive a message from a verified business or a page that you’ve interacted with before, you’re probably in the clear. However, in some rare cases, a business or person may have had their account jeopardized by a scammer. If you’re nervous about this, you can always call a publicly listed phone number for the business and confirm with them that the message you have received is authentic. Never use the contact information provided by a business or person in their direct message if you have any suspicions that they could be a scammer.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eOther social networks\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nWe won’t have time in this blog to describe every single way that you can verify a social media account. There are simply too many and the technology changes all the time! That being said, there is some general advice that you can use to keep yourself safe on services like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eMost social networks provide a blue checkmark to an extremely limited number of businesses and people. Unfortunately, the majority of legitimate businesses cannot receive this checkmark. Use other indicators to confirm a social media account is legitimate like spelling and grammar use, imagery, website links, and addresses. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/how-to-avoid-common-types-of-fraud-spoofing\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eMost scammers will very closely copy a real business or person\\u003c/a\\u003e, but there is often something wrong with these accounts. A misspelling—like replacing an “m” with an “n”—is a common way for fraudsters to trick you into thinking the account is authentic. Think V5ECU versus VSECU!\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eUse two-factor authentication wherever possible to avoid your account being stolen and used for nefarious purposes. Two-factor authentication uses a second method of authentication in addition to your password like a code sent to your phone or generated through an app, which you can then enter in addition to your password. While these systems aren’t foolproof, they can help keep your accounts safer.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eStaying vigilant may be the best way to protect yourself online. Since scammers are usually looking for a quick buck, any obstacles that you put in their way will cause them to quickly move on to their next target. Most social media scams are based on the volume of potential targets, so any difficult targets are usually not worth the fraudster’s time. The simple steps in this blog make you much less vulnerable.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/online-financial-fraud-how-to-keep-your-bank-accounts-safe\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eAvoid wire transfers\\u003c/a\\u003e when possible, especially if someone is requesting that you wire money to claim a prize or correct an “overpayment” for a product they are claiming to send you.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eNever provide Social Security or banking information over social media. Most financial institutions offer some customer support via social media but will redirect you to their contact center once your conversation gets beyond general questions and requires further authentication.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nCongratulations!

Essentially, whenever money comes into our household, it immediately gets divided up into specific “envelopes” that denote what it’s for. We call this giving every dollar a job, and it makes managing expenses and saving extremely efficient. Once you’ve become good at it, a lot of the usual stress that comes with trying to stick with a budget goes away. Part of the reason I think this philosophy works so well for my family is that it lifts the mental load of spending and worrying that you can’t afford something. Rather than guessing how much you can spend on a given category, you just check its designated “envelope.” If there is enough money in there to buy what you need, you’re good to go! It might sound like a minor difference, but in practice, it revolutionizes budgeting. This method is amazing for nearly every type of spending, save one: groceries!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhy am i spending so much on groceries?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nI’ve always struggled to figure out what a reasonable grocery bill looks like for two people. Reading articles about others who manage their money in similar ways, and I’ve found that people tend to be all over the map. Some spend less than $250 and others well over $1,000, even on similar incomes and in similar parts of the United States! No matter what I do to estimate our grocery bill, I always seem to get it wrong, and my grocery “envelope” typically doesn’t have enough money in it at the end of the month to actually cover what we’ve spent on food. This means I have to redistribute or somehow compensate for this discrepancy and my elegant method of budgeting goes right out the window.\\n\\nIn the office, I am widely regarded as a bit obsessive when it comes to budgeting. I live and die by my budget. More often than not, I check it multiple times a day and reconcile my balances multiple times a week. So, when I asked my colleagues how they shop for groceries, a few were surprised that I was shooting in the dark most of the time when going to the grocery store! In-fact, six months ago, a trip to the grocery store would mostly involve a shortlist of wants and a hypothetical list of meals in my head that I knew how to cook. I don’t necessarily enjoy cooking, but I’m pretty good at turning almost any weird selection of food into a tasty dish\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow meal planning helped me spend less\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nOne colleague, in particular, recommended I try meal planning. At first, this idea didn’t appeal to me at all. Meal planning is typically framed as a way to reduce food waste, but my wife and I haven’t really ever found ourselves throwing away food (scraps can almost always be turned into something good to eat). Not to mention, the freeform way that I like to cook usually means that I try to be inspired by what I see in the grocery store, and I don’t want to be beholden to some recipe I find online. But I figured that there was no reason not to try meal planning, at least for a week. If I didn’t like what I discovered, it would be easy to go back to my old habits. My goodness, I am so glad I tried it.\\n\\nI started by finding a meal planning service that was cheap, had a nicely designed app, and fit into how I think about shopping. I stumbled across \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.mealime.com/\\u0022\\u003eMealime\\u003c/a\\u003e, a free service that provides and stores recipes is designed for meal planning, and conveniently orders your grocery list based on the layout of the store where you shop. Some bonus features, like an easy way to share your grocery list, print it or complete a delivery order with one tap, and I was sold. My wife and I spent a few minutes on a Sunday morning picking out four or five meals for the week, each with four servings to accommodate the next day’s lunch, and I headed down the hill to the grocery store.\\n\\nNot only was my grocery bill cheaper than I had expected, but I spent way less time in the store, perfect for these COVID-19 times. It was honestly a bit of a surprise to me what a difference having an organized list made. I simply walked down each aisle, checking off items as I went from top to bottom of my list. Because there was no mental load of trying to figure out what I’d like to cook during the week, I also found myself not picking up those items that might typically rack up the bill! Another benefit? I’ve never spent so much time in the produce section of the store!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe added benefits of meal planning\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nWhen I got home and started cooking, I was even more surprised! The variety of spices that I typically use had suddenly grown, and we found ourselves experiencing flavors that we weren’t used to conjuring in our kitchen. I consider myself a good cook, but I was amazed by the meals I was able to produce with meal planning. It isn’t as if they were complicated, some were far from it, but my mind was opened to different ways to utilize ingredients I’d eaten my whole life.\\n\\nAs for the budget, after a month of meal planning, I took a look back and noticed we’d significantly reduced our grocery bill. I won’t give specifics, but it was a shocking change. Had we really been throwing out food that we didn’t consume before? I don’t think that was it! Like my method of budget, meal planning is remarkably simple because it compartmentalizes the planning and the doing. With envelope budgeting, you fill up your “envelopes” before you receive funds, only spending at a later date. With meal planning, you write down what you’d like to eat before you shop for it. That distinction means less stress, less cost, and tastier meals. As someone who hesitated to try meal planning, I cannot recommend it enough.\\n\\nHere's how I plan our meals:\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eSaturday morning, I browse recipes with my wife, prioritizing cheap ingredients and simple dishes that appeal to our tastes.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eWe select four to six meals, each with roughly four servings so we can eat leftovers for lunch. Often the meals turn out larger than we anticipate, so we end up having plenty of food. When a meal requires something like potatoes, we tend to buy a whole bag, which we repurpose if a particular meal doesn’t use all of them.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eOnce the initial list is complete, I go through our kitchen and check off stuff we already have. It is at this time we also add some basic breakfast foods and snacks that we love, like eggs and bread.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eThe last step is the shopping trip! I usually go on Sunday, but as we are still adjusting to this method of cooking, I occasionally will go midweek.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"row_background_color\":\"white\",\"_row_background_color\":\"field_5e2f5d26eaae3\",\"horizontal_rule\":\"0\",\"_horizontal_rule\":\"field_5989fb5734d75\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66b2646178322\"} /-->",

From where I sit in Montpelier, I can have food delivered from five different grocery stores within two hours. I can place an order online at a local store, have my items gift wrapped, and sent to my family on the other side of the country in only two clicks.\\n\\nUnfortunately, our modern world can also have its drawbacks. Much of the convenience we experience every day relies on putting our personal information on countless websites, order forms, phone trees, social networks, and mobile apps. The more places our information is stored, the more we open ourselves up to fraudulent activity. Luckily, there are some simple ways to reduce risk and keep your information private without sacrificing convenience.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eShop with a credit card\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nCredit cards are a great way to keep your hard-earned money safe when paying for things online or in stores. Rather than you paying the merchant directly with funds from your accounts, the credit card company pays the merchant and you reimburse the credit card company for that service. This important distinction means that your funds are completely isolated from the merchant you are conducting business with. Should a transaction turn out to be fraudulent, you won’t have lost any of your personal money and can rely on the credit card company to handle the dispute.\\n\\nBecause of this, you can remove much of your personal liability by shopping with a credit card. According to \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0219-disputing-credit-card-charges\\u0022\\u003ethe Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA)\\u003c/a\\u003e, the liability for unauthorized use of your credit card tops out at $50. If you report a lost or stolen credit card, you have no liability! This even includes the use of your credit card number. As long as you pay your bills on time and don’t spend more than you have, a credit card is a fantastic tool for keeping your money safe.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eUse chip cards and mobile wallets\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nEven if you do shop with a credit card, you may still worry about the safety and security of the merchant that you’re conducting business with. For example, who knows if a rogue employee could write down the card numbers from recent transactions and use them to buy stuff online? Two recent innovations provide an additional level of protection: the chip card and the mobile wallet. Both technologies work in a similar fashion.\\n\\nWhen you dip a chip card, tap for contactless payment, or scan your mobile wallet, a unique code is created for each transaction. Because this code is different each time you pay, the merchant never knows your real card number! This means that the transaction is more secure than if you just swiped your card, since the data on the magnetic stripe never changes and is the same for every retailer. If someone tried to re-use that transaction code from your chip card or mobile wallet, your financial institution would automatically flag it as fraudulent.\\n\\nMobile wallets also require an additional level of security in the form of a unique device identifier. Without that identifier and the unique code mentioned above, the transaction will not go through successfully. Should you lose your phone, you can always remotely disable these payment options. It’s also worth knowing that many phones use a secure authentication chip to keep your payment data isolated from other apps and services.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eMonitor your credit\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nThe methods outlined above are just a few examples of how financial institutions are hard at work to protect you and your money. While innovations throughout the transaction process have made shopping online or in-person much safer than in years past, the rise of personal data entered online has fraudsters looking for other ways to steal your information and identity.\\n\\nUsing credit and keeping your personal information as private as possible is a good way to reduce your risk, but it isn’t foolproof. There are just some cases where living in the modern world means sharing personal information. In recent years, there have been several large-scale data breaches in which Social Security numbers and other personal information have been leaked to the public or sold online to scammers and fraudsters. One such example is \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement\\u0022\\u003ethe September 2017 Equifax credit bureau hack\\u003c/a\\u003e that exposed the data of 147 million people.\\n\\nIf your information has been leaked or sold, it is possible for fraudsters to open credit accounts and take out loans under your name. Preventing this can be difficult since many identity theft cases arise from data breaches at large organizations that have to keep your information on file. However, it is possible to monitor your credit so you can catch this type of fraud when it arises.\\n\\nTwo tools that are popular and useful for monitoring your credit are \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\\u0022\\u003eAnnualCreditReport.com\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.creditkarma.com/\\u0022\\u003eCredit Karma\\u003c/a\\u003e. These services monitor your credit reports with the three major credit bureaus (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.experian.com/\\u0022\\u003eExperian\\u003c/a\\u003e, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.transunion.com/\\u0022\\u003eTransUnion\\u003c/a\\u003e, and \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.equifax.com/personal/\\u0022\\u003eEquifax\\u003c/a\\u003e) and can let you know when there are changes to those reports. If someone tried to open a loan or a credit card under your name, you would see evidence of that in your credit report and could immediately take action to protect yourself.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eProtect your credit\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nShould you see suspicious activity on your credit report, a great first step is to contact the lender involved directly. Since lenders sometimes use third parties to execute credit inquiries, you may learn that you did in fact authorize the inquiry. If the inquiry was made in error or the lender cannot confirm the account, you can ask them to reach out to each reporting credit agency and request to have the inquiry removed. Be sure to take notes during your call with the lender, including the name of the customer service representative who you spoke to—this makes any follow-up conversations easier, particularly if you can speak with that person again.\\n\\nThe next step would be to contact the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.ftc.gov/\\u0022\\u003eFederal Trade Commission (FTC)\\u003c/a\\u003e, which can help recover your identity and stop further fraud from happening. Most identity theft victims do not need to file a police report in order to begin the process.\\n\\nYou can also reach out to the three credit bureaus directly and explain what is going on. Asking them to enable fraud alerts on your identity can be a useful way to keep track of any suspicious credit inquiries. If you don’t plan on applying for a new loan or a credit card in the near future, you can also request that they freeze your credit. This prevents new accounts from being opened in your name and is a great way to reduce your risk. Don’t worry, though—if you freeze your credit and decide you need to open an account or apply for a loan in the near future, you can temporarily lift the freeze for a set period of time.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eLayer your security options\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIf all of this feels overwhelming, you’re not alone. The reality is that doing just a few things to protect your money and your identity can immediately make you less of a target for fraudsters and scammers. Here are some general recommendations to keep your information safe:\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cdiv\\u003eUse a credit card when shopping online or in person. Wherever possible, dip or tap your card, or pay with a mobile wallet, rather than swiping. It's more secure!\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eTurn on notifications for all your financial institutions. This way you’ll be notified immediately of any transactions. If you see one you don’t recognize, you can immediately report it as fraudulent.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eSign up for a credit monitoring service like \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\\u0022\\u003eAnnualCreditReport.com\\u003c/a\\u003e or \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.creditkarma.com/\\u0022\\u003eCredit Karma\\u003c/a\\u003e. Some types of accounts, including debit and credit accounts, have \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/financial/deposits/edge-pay\\u0022\\u003eadditional identity theft protection and credit monitoring built right in\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eIf you get a phone call from someone claiming to be from an institution that might reasonably need your information, tell them you’ll call back and find the phone number from a trusted source. It’s easy to fake caller ID and you should always be the one to initiate a call where personal information is shared.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eKeep your digital devices up to date and secured with a password or passcode, especially if you have chosen to store your credit, debit, rewards, and transit cards on them.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eUse a password manager to keep track of where you’ve shared personal information and randomize all of your passwords.

So far, my wife and I have successfully navigated our finances through three different times in our lives: dating as students, living together, and getting married. These are the three ways we tackled the “money conversation.”\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe  “early days\\u0022 phase\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nAs in many early relationships, we both had separate, private checking and savings accounts. Neither of us had credit cards, so life was simple! Each month we would send two separate checks to our landlord, each for fifty percent of the total, and we paid for \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/meal-planning-to-save-money\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003egroceries\\u003c/a\\u003e, internet, and electricity in a very similar manner. As long as we were able to contribute our fifty percent on time, we could do whatever we wanted with the rest of our available funds. This made the most sense for us early in our relationship, where having the independence and security of separate finances was important. It also allowed us to live more affordably since we were sharing the financial load.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTHE “WORKING FULL TIME” PHASE\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nAfter we moved to Vermont for work, it was time to address our financial situation again. Life was changing and our relationship had become much more serious. We decided it was time to open a shared checking account and start thinking about our money more like a couple. It took a little bit of work and a great many conversations to figure out a new system that worked for us.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nLike before, we kept our individual \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/how-to-balance-your-checkbook\\u0022 aria-label=\\u0022How to balance your checkbook\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003echecking accounts\\u003c/a\\u003e as the primary accounts to deposit our paychecks, but now we would cover our shared expenses from our new joint checking account. A gigantic financial spreadsheet was born—a re-creation with convenient round numbers is below, which you can also \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://go.vsecu.com/hubfs/assets/Personal%20Expenses%20Template.xlsx\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003edownload to use for your own shared expenses\\u003c/a\\u003e—as a tool to make sure the money was flowing to the right accounts. This spreadsheet was critical to the way we managed our money together as it told us exactly how much of each paycheck to transfer to our shared account.\\n\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://go.vsecu.com/hubfs/assets/Personal%20Expenses%20Template.xlsx\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png?width=700\\u0026amp;name=managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png\\u0022 sizes=\\u0022(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\u0022 srcset=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png?width=350\\u0026amp;name=managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png 350w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png?width=700\\u0026amp;name=managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png 700w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png?width=1050\\u0026amp;name=managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png 1050w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png?width=1400\\u0026amp;name=managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png 1400w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png?width=1750\\u0026amp;name=managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png 1750w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png?width=2100\\u0026amp;name=managing_relationship_finances_spreadsheet-1.png 2100w\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Personal expenses template\\u0022 width=\\u0022700\\u0022 /\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nIt worked by combining our pre-tax income and then divvying up our expenses based on what percentage of the whole each of us made. This way, if one of us was making significantly more than the other, that person would pay a proportional amount of our expenses. For example, if one of us was making 60% of our total income, that person would also be responsible for covering 60% of our expenses. The idea was to make it fair, manage our spending as a couple, and still preserve some of the freedom we’d become accustomed to.\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\nWhile we loved our percentage-based spreadsheet, naturally it wasn’t perfect. For example, we weren’t yet saving as a couple since any leftover money from immediate obligations (like rent or groceries) was for each of us to use as we pleased. We also had no way of navigating the world of credit, and our system didn’t account for sudden changes in our financial circumstances, such as unemployment. As we prepared to get married last August, it was time to re-invent our financial wheel.\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe “marriage” phase\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nAs a married couple, we decided our individual checking accounts would no longer be our primary accounts by default. Instead, our shared account and new shared credit cards would take over that role and our individual checking accounts would be for personal spending money—after expenses and savings had been covered, of course.\\n\\nOur new system also has a big spreadsheet that essentially acts as a guide but no longer relies on percentages. Instead, our paychecks are deposited directly into the same shared account. In this system, the couple always comes before the individual. It is only after all of our obligations, our shared goals, and our shared savings have been taken care of each month that we distribute whatever is left for our personal spending. We each get exactly half of our leftover funds in our individual accounts; if I want to go out and buy a video game or \\u003cem\\u003eanother\\u003c/em\\u003e pair of headphones that are just for me, that spending money comes out of my individual account. If there is no money in there, I have to wait.\\n\\nWe’ve always been big fans of the envelope method of \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/how-to-make-a-budget\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003ebudgeting\\u003c/a\\u003e, where any money coming in immediately gets put into a spending category. As soon as our paychecks hit, the money is organized using a \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/the-best-free-budgeting-apps-to-help-you-save-money\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003ebudgeting app\\u003c/a\\u003e called \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.youneedabudget.com/\\u0022\\u003eYou Need A Budget (YNAB)\\u003c/a\\u003e. We operate using roughly fifty different “envelopes,” or spending categories, that span everything from vacations to eating out. YNAB even tracks our credit card purchases and automatically moves money from one spending envelope to the credit card payment envelope so we never run a balance. If we want to buy something, we create a new envelope to add money whenever we can. Until we’ve hit our goal and the envelope for that item is full, we don’t spend money on that item because our system shows that we can’t afford it.\\n\\nOur new system has a few benefits that our old system did not. The envelope method of budgeting provides financial transparency around our spending habits. With YNAB (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/the-four-best-budgeting-apps-worth-paying-for\\u0022\\u003eor another budgeting app\\u003c/a\\u003e, if you choose), we both have access to our accounts and can easily see what is going on. I do not exaggerate when I say I check our budget two to three times a day.\\n\\nOne particularly important benefit of our new system is our ability to save as a couple. This has enabled us to build a small emergency fund, as well as a “just in case” envelope separate from our emergency goal. One of our financial goals is to provide a buffer so that paychecks are not being spent on bills immediately upon hitting our accounts. Combined with an emergency fund, we have a cushion if, for some reason, one of us lost our job or had a medical emergency—we’d have a few months of bills already budgeted for to get us through the hard times.\\n\\nDid we get to where we are overnight? Absolutely not. It took years of thinking about money, talking about money, and learning about money to find a system that worked for us as our relationship progressed. We leaned on friends, co-workers, and family for advice and support. As much as our systems have helped at the end of the day it takes discipline to stick to the system and make the most out of our money.\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAn important note about equity in personal finance\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nI feel like it is impossible to talk about anyone’s personal history with money without mentioning two important things. Firstly, everyone is going to have a different capacity to follow through on their budgeting plan. If you aren’t able to reach your financial goals, it isn’t necessarily because you’re bad at handling money or you aren’t working hard enough. Because of a number inequities and biases in this country, there are people working harder or longer than my wife or I have who still find it difficult to get ahead financially. We’re incredibly lucky for the opportunities we’ve had, and we feel grateful for them every single day.\\n\\nSecondly, it’s important to remember that any time you hear someone talk about their personal finances, it is just that—their \\u003cem\\u003epersonal\\u003c/em\\u003e finances. You shouldn’t feel pressure to manage your finances the way my wife and I have, and you shouldn’t compare your situation to ours! My hope is that this blog is helpful to you in some small way, and that you get something out of it to help you on your own personal finance journey.\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"row_background_color\":\"white\",\"_row_background_color\":\"field_5e2f5d26eaae3\",\"horizontal_rule\":\"0\",\"_horizontal_rule\":\"field_5989fb5734d75\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66b2646178322\"} /-->",

Tenants will need to declare a significant disruption to their income, such as the loss of a job, reduction of hours, or extraordinary medical expenses. Tenants must also demonstrate they have made a substantial effort to apply for government aid or other assistance, and show that eviction could result in homelessness or force them to live in close quarters with a lot of other people. This new order is expected to cover far more renters than previous federal efforts that expired in July.\\n\\nAt this time, it is unclear how Vermonters may benefit since the CDC’s order does not apply to states where there are already eviction protections that provide “the same or greater level of public-health protection.”\\n\\nBack in May of this year, \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://vtdigger.org/2020/05/15/scott-signs-bill-establishing-moratorium-on-evictions-foreclosures-%EF%BB%BF/\\u0022\\u003eGovernor Phil Scott signed a bill that protects Vermonters from evictions\\u003c/a\\u003e during the Vermont COVID-19 State of Emergency. To help tenants catch up on any back payments to their landlords, the bill extended the eviction protection to 30 days after the state of emergency has concluded. The Vermont law did not freeze rents or provide rent forgiveness. The new CDC order similarly does not offer financial assistance to tenants—renters are still responsible for their rental payments. Neither piece of legislation prevents evictions due to other violations of rental contracts, such as unsafe living conditions.\\n\\nOne scenario where the CDC order may apply to Vermonters is if Vermont’s state of emergency ends before January 1, 2021. In this scenario, Vermont renters would be prevented from eviction until the end of the year by the federal order rather than state legislation.\\n\\nBoth the Vermont law and the CDC order are intended primarily to avoid a significant rise in homelessness during COVID-19, but do nothing to help alleviate back payments due to months of unemployment. There has been \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/01/world/covid-19-coronavirus.html#link-26bc7ab3\\u0022\\u003eample criticism from the National Multifamily Housing Council\\u003c/a\\u003e and renters, who say that the CDC’s moratorium on evictions is just “kicking the can down the road.” It can be difficult to recover from months of lost income in the best of times—COVID-19 makes it even more difficult. Without financial assistance, renters and landlords may need to come up with alternative arrangements after these measures expire.

While over 140 million Americans have received their Economic Impact Payment from the federal government by direct deposit or as a check in the mail, a third form of payment may be arriving for those of you still waiting.\\n\\nOn May 18, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1012\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eannounced that roughly four million Economic Impact Payments will be sent in the mail as a prepaid debit card\\u003c/a\\u003e, often referred to as an EIP card.\\n\\nThe debit card is a VISA card issued by MetaBank, the Treasury’s financial agent, and will look like this:\\n\\nStill have questions?

The debit cards are being sent to individuals who did not provide bank account information on their 2018 or 2019 tax returns, and therefore couldn’t receive payment via direct deposit. Recipients also will have had their returns processed at one of two IRS centers, including the Andover, Massachusetts which handles tax returns for Vermont residents.

If you use an out-of-network ATM, there is a two-dollar fee that will be waived for your first transaction. This does not include any fees that the ATM operator may charge on top of your withdrawal. So the short answer is yes, you should be mindful about how you use your EIP card at the ATM.

I sat down with Yvonne Garand, our senior vice president of marketing and business development, to talk about personal finance in the age of COVID-19.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cem\\u003eThis transcript has been edited for clarity.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver Ames:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Hello, everybody! Welcome to today's livestream. We are super excited to have you here, tuning in live on Facebook. We're going to be talking today with Yvonne Garand, the senior vice president of marketing and business development. I'm Oliver Ames, the social media specialist here at VSECU.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday we're going to be providing you with some helpful resources to navigate the financial world in this uncertain time. Of course, we've been doing many things internally at VSECU to make sure that we are prepared and that our staff are prepared. We've been putting all kinds of policies in place to keep people safe in our workplaces. We've sent as many people remotely as possible. But as we look to coming out of this in hopefully a few weeks, we are still conscious that the impacts from COVID-19 are going to remain for quite some time for our members.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we thought we'd do today is sit down and provide you with information right from the financial world to your home. So, without further ado, I'm going to pass it over to Yvonne, and we're going to have a little conversation here. All righty Yvonne. Let's get into it! Welcome to the stream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eYvonne Garand\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Thank you, Oliver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Today, we're going to talk about, as I mentioned, the impact payments; the economy; budgeting and spending; and how to navigate the world of personal finance right now. But let's start off with a simple question: what are some great financial habits or routines that people should get into?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Hmmm, good question. First of all, thank you for coordinating this! This is new and different. Many of us, with the stay-at-home order, are having to adapt and work and communicate differently. So, I appreciate this opportunity to converse with you, and others who are watching, from the comforts of my home.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think probably first and foremost, as we are all sheltering in place and getting to know our family members a little bit better, maybe getting to know ourselves a little bit better, this is a good time to get to know your money better. And what I mean by that is take advantage of this time to get a better understanding of your money.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere is it? Where is it coming from? Where does it need to go in? What is it doing? So really maximize and leverage this opportunity to carve out time in your day and start thinking about your money in that way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: One of the things that I do personally, and I think we recommend people do this all the time, is to think through the things that are coming in and the things that are going out. One of the things that is so great about 2020, living in today's age of COVID aside, is that we have enormous numbers of tools at our fingertips. From tools like online and mobile banking, to phone services and apps. You could even use third-party tools that integrate with VSECU services like Mint or You Need A Budget. How do you think people can manage their expenses and their income more efficiently and effectively?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Right. First of all, I want to address the technological advances that are going to come into play as a benefit right now. You mentioned some apps that people can download to help budget and monitor their expenses. So, the digital ecosystem that we live in today is a wonderful thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only caveat to the digital technologies that so many of us have become reliant on is that we really don't know where we're spending our money. It's so easy to enroll in online banking, use your debit card, and the days of balancing a checking account are long gone. I would encourage people to take a piece of paper and a pen or pencil and try reconciling your account. What that will do for you is it will mentally and visually help you see where your money is being spent, how is it coming in and how is it going out. Once you have that understanding, then by all means, rely on those digital technologies. But it is so important not to become complacent, especially during these times. It's just so important for us to know what our capacity is!\\r\\n\\r\\nI still am one of those old timers. I still reconcile my checking account every month. I have four adult children, and I know they don't. They don't because the digital economy has made it so easy for us. But I still think that reconciling your accounts is a good exercise to practice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Not to mention, we live in a world with all kinds of subscription services. There's Netflix; there's Spotify. There are so many tools and applications that people can use out there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I know that even in my own home, I'm subscribing to services that I've never subscribed to before! To keep ourselves entertained, we're watching more Netflix, Hulu, and other video streaming services. I know many households are subscribing to other services like grocery delivery through Instacart. I don't know if this exists in Vermont, but I know that Uber Eats is a great delivery service. There are even meal preparation services from companies like Hello Fresh or Blue Apron! These services are all very meaningful and helpful during these times.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, for those of us who have our mobile phones in our hand every day, we're being offered these trial subscriptions. And of course, many of us are signing up for them because what else are we going to do while we're sitting around at home! So, if you do take advantage of any of these subscription services, there a couple of things to remember. And when I say remember, I mean jot it down somewhere so that you know you won't forget.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep track of all of the services that you've subscribed to with those trial offers so that at the end of the 30 days, if you decide that the service is no longer valuable, you can terminate it. A lot of these subscription services say “free for the first 30 days,” but they actually capture your payment information, knowing that they'll have it so that if you don't terminate at the end of 30 days, they have your payment information and then they'll continue to bill you. One, two or three months later, you realize with your credit card statement that you're getting billed and then you have to call the company to cancel. So just keep track of those new subscription services.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Something that I like to do whenever I sign up for a new service, or I am trialing a new service, is I go ahead and I add the renewal date to my calendar. That way, I get a notification on my phone a few days before the subscription renews. Then, I can make a conscious decision if I want to continue my subscription.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think what a lot of these companies rely on when it comes to subscription services is recurring revenue. It's hitting your account every month on a regular basis, and so it's actually beneficial for them if you forget about them. Those little charges, even though it may only be ten dollars a month or something like that, they really build up over time and make a big impact in your life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've got a list on paper of all the subscription services that I subscribe to. Every now and then I take a look at that, and I say, “You know what? Turns out I'm not really using that service a lot!” By the way, they will happily have you back if you ever want to re-subscribe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yes, that is very, very true! The other thing that I wanted to address, Oliver, is I think for people to think about saving right now is difficult, because we know that so many people have lost their jobs, either permanently or they're out on furlough. We have a lot of small businesses in Vermont that have been required to close, so cash flow is not happening in many households. So, it's tough to think about how to save money when you don't have enough money coming in. Here a couple of other sensible tips.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, the interest rate environment is low again. It might be a great time to find ways to maybe even refinance your mortgage. Anything you can do to decrease your monthly outflow right now is something that you should be paying attention to.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re all bombarded with credit card offers in the mail. Many of them promote a zero percent or very low interest rate. We've always said at VSECU, use your credit, but use your credit wisely. I'm not a big proponent of leveraging expenses through credit cards, but credit cards do serve a very important purpose. I think in our environment today, this is the time to use those tools, but use those tools wisely. Use your credit but use it wisely.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are taking advantage of those low introductory rates or zero percent rates, just like your subscription services, make sure you're reading the fine print and have an understanding of when that wonderful offer is going to disappear. Because if you don't pay attention to it, who knows, you may be charged a significant interest rate on your credit card. So, use those tools, but use those tools wisely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Right. That's great advice! Can you tell us a little bit about the difference between a budget and a spending plan? I think that is an important distinction for people to know about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nYvonne:\\u003c/strong\\u003e I think it's more psychological, Oliver, than a tactical practice. One of my colleagues actually wrote a blog about this. When we use the word budget, for many people it evokes the feeling of scarcity. “What I don't have.” “I must budget because I don't have enough.” Whereas spending is more about what you do have. I would encourage people to try to shift your mindset from what I don't have to what I do have.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why I said earlier that it is a great time to get to know your money. Understand where it resides. Know where it is coming from. What are the necessities that you need in your life for you and your family in your household? Think about what you have and manage how you're going to spend it versus budgeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a lot of people who are somewhat paralyzed with fear right now. Because lives have absolutely been disrupted, not just from the physical distancing that we're doing and the lack of social connection and human connection with people.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all know that our financial capabilities and financial wellbeing have such a tremendous impact on our mental health first and foremost, and money can create incredible stress if we don't have the capacity to meet the obligations that we have. The reality is even though I'm talking about a psychological mindset shift, there are people out in Vermont and listening here that truly have lost a source of income. They truly are in a situation where they need to modify and rely on resources that are available to help get them through this time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Just a personal anecdote here: I always struggled with figuring out how to effectively budget for just this reason. The idea of budgeting, without already having a budget, was such a difficult thing to wrap my mind around. Switching to thinking about what I was proud of having really made a big difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of resources in general, let’s talk about emergency savings and why it is so important to have some built up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: The Great Recession of 2008 was a real eye opener for many people. That truly was a financial disaster. The Great Recession happened because of a financial pandemic, whereas today what we're dealing with is a health pandemic. But still, in both scenarios, it's so important to have a rainy-day fund.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Great Recession, many people recognized that perhaps they had not been disciplined and saving money in that rainy-day fund. So, let's talk a little bit about savings and emergency funds, because I actually see them as two separate types of saving.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all, saving is hard to do, right? I like to recommend that people try to find some sort of automated process or methodology to pay yourself first. I always recommend that people use direct deposit if you're getting a paycheck. Direct deposit that paycheck into your account or accounts, and make sure that you're taking a certain dollar amount or percentage, and deposit it into a savings account. If you don't see it, you're not going to be tempted to spend it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, I'm going to talk about the psychological mindset! Instead of thinking about savings as money, think about savings as your personal goals. We all want to achieve our personal goals. So maybe you're saving because you're going to get married, you want to start a family, you want a down payment for a new vehicle, you want to go on vacation, you want to buy a new computer. What a great feeling as humans when we achieve our personal goals! that's the purpose of savings.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo your point, Oliver, emergency savings is a little different. Everybody should have that cookie jar full of savings for times like these. A good rule of thumb is that three to six months of your monthly living expenses should be tucked away in that cookie jar so that when we are faced with uncertainty or disruption in our lives like today, you will have access to cash flow so that you can continue to maintain your spending obligations.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know right now you're thinking, “Oh great, but I don't have an emergency fund.” It's okay! It's never too late to start saving, and it's never too late to take just a little bit of that money and start putting it in the emergency fund.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Just a few dollars a day can make a big difference in the long run! I remember when I was first building my own emergency fund, I kept thinking to myself, “Oh, well. I'm going to start by just putting aside an expensive cup of coffee every day.” Instead of getting a latte, I'm going to put aside some a little bit of money and just build it up. That really helped me get the momentum to save even more and make some of those bigger life adjustments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I'm so glad that you use that as an example, Oliver, because that goes back to what I said at the beginning about getting to know your money and reconciling where you're spending your money.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's so easy today for all of us to make our purchases using that little piece of plastic. If we are not aware of how many times we're swiping it or entering that number online, buying your coffee, your latte, that can really add up. I know it can sound like a mind-boggling exercise, but just take your last month’s spending activity. Look at it and identify how you're spending your money. I'm going to bet that that exercise will inform how you can change some of your purchasing behavior. This will help you put aside more money for savings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: This is a perfect segue into talking about some of the resources that are out there for people. Maybe you were in a great financial situation, and COVID-19 came in and made things quite difficult for you. Maybe you are seeing the end of your emergency goal that you had saved up for years—your buffer to make sure that you could withstand something like this.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly, this advice is so important as we come out of this, but for some of us, the reality of unemployment, or simply putting food on the table, is difficult to deal with. A lot of Vermonters that didn't have trouble getting food on the table a few months ago are suddenly living in a new reality. Let’s talk a little bit about some resources for feeding your family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/free-local-food-resources-to-feed-your-family-during-the-pandemic\\u0022\\u003eThere is a great blog on our website written by the executive director of Hunger Free Vermont\\u003c/a\\u003e. In that blog, she lists the many resources that are available to Vermonters. What I learned when I read the blog myself was that in Vermont, the government has actually set up a 211 telephone line. Any Vermonter can just text or dial 211 to be placed into a system that keeps you updated on all of the different community and nonprofit resources around a variety of issues. Food is one of them. Childcare and healthcare information is also included.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that all of the school districts, through some point in June, Oliver, are offering free breakfasts and lunches for students up to the age of 18. If you have a family and are faced with some sort of financial hardship, and you know food is such a basic essential need, take advantage of programs like these.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also the [Women Infant Children] (WIC) program that aids families who have small children, pregnant mothers, and new mothers, and the 3Squares Vermont program, which I think nationally is better known as the SNAP program.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is hard sometimes to put yourself out there and ask for help. I'll share that I personally have had to do that twice in my life. It was short term, but these services exist for a reason. It's really tough sometimes to take your pride and just park it for a second. I encourage you to look into these resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot to mention, the largest food distributor in our state to help eradicate hunger is the Vermont Food Bank. The Vermont Foodbank works with many local food shelves and other nonprofits. So look to see what is available in your community, and take advantage of those services.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also want to pivot just a little bit right here, Oliver, because we're talking about people who are in need and the difficulty of really putting yourself out there and asking for help. For those people who are NOT in pinch and who aren't currently having the stress of not putting food on the table, this is also a time to give. If you have the capacity to give right now, if you have not been impacted financially, now's a great time to give to organizations like the Vermont Foodbank.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know it's going to sound like a little bit of a plug, but at VSECU we have a statewide event called The Point to Point. It is a day-long bike ride with different mileage bike rides where people, as individuals or as teams, get to do something they love, which is riding their bike in the beautiful mountains of Vermont, as part of their fundraising. This year, The Point to Point is scheduled for the beginning of August. If you're interested in donating money to the Vermont Foodbank, I invite you to visit www.thepointtopoint.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne modification we have made with this program is that any donations that are coming in now as a result of fundraising we are now earmarking, processing that and immediately giving it to the Vermont Foodbank, rather than waiting for this large lump sum of money that is transferred over in August.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I believe that is correct! Let’s talk a little bit about emergency impact payments. This is part of the CARES act, the $2.2 trillion spending bill passed by Congress. A lot of our members have already seen their payments arrive in their accounts. We have had a number of blog posts talking both about the impact payments themselves but also some of the myths that are surrounding them. There’s a lot of misinformation out there online, especially on social networks like the one they're on right now, so we have been kind of going around trying to correct that misinformation and make sure people really know all the details.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-your-irs-stimulus-payment/\\u0022\\u003eHow do people find out if they are eligible for the stimulus payment\\u003c/a\\u003e? How do they get their payment, and how they find out where it is, especially if they have not gotten it already?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I would recommend everyone go to the IRS webpage at \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003eirs.gov/eip\\u003c/a\\u003e. When you get to that page, you are going to be faced with two choices, I believe. There will be a button that says, “track my payment,” something like that. If you click on that button, it will guide you through the process to see whether or not you're eligible and if your payment is on its way or has been delivered.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the stimulus payment first came out there was a little bit of chaos and a little bit of misunderstanding. Here’s what we know: if you have filed your 2018 or your 2019 tax returns and are eligible, you are automatically going to receive that stimulus payment. When you filed those tax returns, if you included a bank account number and a routing number, your stimulus check is going to automatically be deposited into that account.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you filed your taxes and you did not provide that information, I believe there's two things that could happen. One, if you go to that website you can enter your bank information now and then the deposit will be made. The stimulus payment will get to you a lot faster than if you waited for an actual check to be mailed to you through the Postal Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was also some confusion at the beginning around if people who receive Social Security benefits or other governmental benefits would have to file a return in order to be eligible. This is false. If you do receive Social Security benefits or any other supplemental governmental benefits, you are eligible and you will receive a stimulus payment. The IRS has your information and they'll send you your payment.\\r\\n\\r\\nI still would encourage you to go to that website, however, and track your payment. If you want the payment as fast as possible, the IRS just needs to know where to automatically direct deposit that money.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/top-five-myths-about-irs-stimulus-payments\\u0022\\u003eA couple of myths\\u003c/a\\u003e: I know that you wrote a blog about this, Oliver, so feel free to chime in if I've missed anything. First and foremost, the stimulus is not taxable. This money is for your use. This money is not taxable and you don't have to pay it back.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that there was also some confusion around if someone received a check in an amount that was more than what they had anticipated based on the methodology or calculation. Some people were asking questions about if the IRS inadvertently pays me more than what I was supposed to receive, am I going to have to pay it back? No, you're not going to have to pay it back. The IRS is not going to ask you to pay back any amount of money that they may have accidentally over overpaid you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the last question is, you know, is there still time? And the answer is yes. If you haven't received your check yet, please go to that website. The government wants to make sure that every eligible person in our country receives this stimulus payment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yes, that's fantastic! The FTC has been very vocal talking about how if somebody calls you saying that they're from the IRS and asking you to pay back some of the money that you got, this is a known scam. Most of us are good people. So, if a check comes in and we think it might be wrong and somebody calls us, people are good people and will hand over their information. That’s where people can get taken advantage of.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think you covered most of the myths Yvonne, but remember with a lot of these things, there's still information coming out. You would be surprised how even today new information comes out about the stimulus payments.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, we have a lot of people that write to us every day and say, “Well, why haven't I received my payment yet when I hear other people have received the payment!” That’s just because they're rolling it out in waves. You may not have been in the first batch, but maybe you'll be in the second or third batch, or so on and so forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's also been a lot of information about when the physical checks are coming, if you don't have direct deposit. The initial timeline that they gave was quite long, but they have worked as hard as they can to start accelerating that process. But again, of course, the fastest way to get it is going to be to use direct deposit and get that right into your accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll right, let's talk about spending that money. I will add that there is a real spectrum of people here, from people who have not been financially impacted to those that have been financially impacted. So, we may want to talk about those two things separately, but I'll hand it over to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Well, certainly how you spend that stimulus payment is going to vary based on your individual needs and how you have been impacted financially by COVID. I think the best way to give an answer for everyone here is to think about your spending as a pyramid, or an upside-down funnel if you will, and think about the base layer of that pyramid being your foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the foundation we all have basic needs like food, heat, and shelter. If you need to use any of that stimulus payment to meet those basic human essential needs, then that's where I would recommend that you spend it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, if you start to go up that pyramid, or down in the funnel, the next tier is debt. We know that most of us have debt. We have monthly payments like a mortgage payment, a car payment, and a credit card payment. Under normal circumstances I would recommend that you pay off all of your debt as quickly as possible. Because that, in a way, is an automatic savings plan. But \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/how-to-deal-with-financial-hardship-due-to-the-coronavirus\\u0022\\u003eif you are experiencing financial hardship\\u003c/a\\u003e and your incoming monies is not as much as you need, again, use your credit but use it wisely. I now am recommending, during these times, that you make the minimum payment due on all of your loans to shore up the excess of that $1,200 or whatever amount you've received.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, I would park it and save it. Whatever you have left. Save it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter savings, if you are in a situation where you haven't negatively been impacted by COVID-19, the next level is investing. Invest the money.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, if you have the capacity, maybe you want to use this money to give. I talked about the Vermont Foodbank before, or give to a family member, your church, or some other non-profit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the circumstances are going to be different for each individual so hopefully that’s helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I think that is super helpful! \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/five-ways-to-spend-your-stimulus-payment-wisely\\u0022\\u003eThere is a whole blog about this as well\\u003c/a\\u003e. There are some graphics in there such as the pyramid you were describing.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooks like we are getting close to the end of our stream here! We are going to talk about the economy in a minute, both the local economy and some other things, but before we do that though, let's touch on fraud. I think our fraud department would be unhappy if I didn't mention fraud!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Right. Those sneaky little fraudsters! Scams are so effective right now because fraudsters take advantage of vulnerable people, fearful people, especially in situations like we're in today with COVID.\\r\\n\\r\\nA couple of things to remember. The whole purpose of a scam is to try to extract from you your personal information, your non-public information. They want your social security number. They want your account number. And they are very, very tricky.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, you might receive a phone call at home and hear someone say, \\u0022Hi, I'm calling from the Social Security Administration office. If you want your stimulus check, we need to update your records. Could I please have your social security number?\\u0022 Don't give them your social security number!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this digital ecosystem, we are seeing most of the fraud happen through email phishing. You'll receive an email that looks completely legitimate, but it isn’t. I'll give you an example. Here in Vermont we know that all of our hair salons, beauty salons, are closed. I know of one case where someone received an email. It looked completely legitimate, and it said, \\u0022COVID relief for hair salon owners. Click here to apply for your $500 grant.\\u0022 It sounds incredibly tempting, right? Never click on anything in an email that you've received if you haven't asked for someone to communicate with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can tell you that at VSECU we will never make an outbound phone call and ask for your account number, ask for your social security number. Do not ever give out those two pieces of information to anybody unless you're the one who has initiated the primary contact and it's with an organization that you're already doing business with.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: We actually have, as I mentioned just a moment ago, a fraud department that is working on behalf of our membership to protect people. If you're not with VSECU, chances are your credit union or bank also has a fraud department and is working diligently on your behalf.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow more than ever is a really good time to make sure that the numbers that are calling you are the ones that you expect and that you're not giving out private information unless you are the one that initiates that request for information. The IRS isn't going to call you about your stimulus payment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst thing is that these fraudsters and these scammers are, unfortunately, really creative. Because so much of our lives is experienced in the public, online, it's very easy for them to get just a little bit of information about you. Even knowing where you work can be a leaping off point to take advantage of you. As always, make sure you know who you're sharing with. Know that the internet, even if it says it's private, isn't necessarily private. Be more mindful than ever before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have taken many steps here at the credit union to prepare ourselves for this. We have made some changes in our internal policies that have made us even more secure than we were before. We’ve really put a lot of time and effort into making sure that we're protecting your information. We also want to help by \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/protect-your-finances-from-fraud-during-covid-19\\u0022\\u003egiving you the tools that you need\\u003c/a\\u003e to do the same thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s wrap up our show today and talk about the economy. What do you have to say about the economy, Yvonne?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Well, I wish I had a crystal ball!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Not to drop you on the spot or anything like that!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That’s a great question! Well, a couple of things. One, we've been here before. This isn't the first time that there's been some catastrophic event that has negatively impacted the economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hear a lot of people worry that the market, what we know as Wall Street, is the economy. I think it's important to remember those two things are very different. The market is not the economy. The market typically has a very forward-thinking attitude. The market doesn't like uncertainty. The market has already built into the cost of buying and selling different companies how COVID is going to impact the economy. The overall economy is more about output. The economy is about consumer consumption, supply and demand, and employment. So, try to keep those two things separate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I can share with you is I believe that the market has factored in today (or actually factored in a while ago) the impact of COVID. I believe that the market has already factored in that we are either in a recession or we are about to head into a recession. I'm hopeful that as local and state governments allow businesses to thoughtfully reopen, we will start to see some kind of recovery. There's been a lot of talk about it being, you know, this sharp V shaped recovery, but it could also be U shaped or L shaped. I don't know what shape of recovery it's going to be, but I am confident that we will have a recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went through World War Two, the Great Depression, the 70s, oil embargos, Y2K, Black Monday, the Great Recession. What history has taught us is that resiliency exists in the fabric of our society. We will get through this. There will be a recovery. I know that there's a lot of pain, and I'm not in any way diminishing that, but we will get through this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yes! I think one thing that's important to realize is that COVID-19 is different from some other economic slides that we've seen in the past. Can you talk to that?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Absolutely! We intentionally shut down the economy to protect the health and wellbeing of people. Other recessions, other negative economic environments, have really been the result of either a financial crisis or some other catastrophe. Think about 9/11, if you will.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat's unique about this particular environment that we're in is that we consciously and intentionally made the decision to pause the economy. Prior to COVID this economy was working very, very, very well. We had the lowest unemployment. People were earning, you know, the most money that they've earned in years.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it's important to be mindful that this was a conscientious step that all of us are taking collectively together to protect the health and wellbeing of people. Once we get through this, and we will, there is going to be some pent-up demand, and the economy will start rolling again. It may look different, but I'm confident that... I don't know... If I had a crystal ball... Oliver, I don't know if it's six months, twelve months, eighteen months, but we will get through this.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to have the opportunity to make this statement before you ask any other question. It's really difficult in times like this to practice gratitude, especially if you are financially hurting, or worse yet, if you have physically been impacted by COVID. I just want to leave with everyone that when we practice gratitude in times of good and bad, it can create such energy in humanity. I believe that humans are resilient. I believe in community. I believe it can take a village. I also believe in humility. That if you have to ask for help, whether to a family member or friend or community outlet, you have permission to do that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Right! That local aspect of it is a great segue to my last few questions here. We've already talked about this a little bit, but if you can spend money, if you haven't been impacted financially, what's a way that you can support our local economy?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Great question! So many local businesses, who cannot be open to the public right now, have been very creative and innovative with curbside service and offering gift certificates. So, please do support your local main street businesses. I know in our family we're trying once a week to make sure that we order a meal from a local restaurant. We'll pick it up with a curbside service.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can pay in advance for some type of personal services. I know that there are some hair salons that are accepting pre-payment for future haircuts which helps the cash flow of these businesses. Buying gift certificates I think is another big one, so that when businesses open, the recipients of those gift cards can transact with these businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, that's a fantastic thing. I live in Montpelier, and there's a local burger place. We ordered burgers from them very early on, and they were doing curbside service. They were really happy that I had come in part because typically the way that you and I, and most people, discover businesses is we drive down the street, we see what's open, we might look at a menu and look at what's good. That type of interaction is not something that we're doing right now. So, the discovery of businesses is hard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's a couple of things that you can do as both a business owner, but also as a consumer, to help this problem. If you have bought food at a place or gone and had something delivered—I think my brother just had a book delivered from a local bookstore—tell your friends about it, tell your family about it, tell people who can also use those services about it, and post it on social media. Spread the resources that are available.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other thing is you can call a lot of places. Just call them on the phone. You can find their phone number, usually on Google or other tools like that, and just see what they're doing. A lot of the businesses that may not have big web presences or huge social network followings are having trouble getting the word out. But everyone's answering the phone. Right now, if you're craving human connection, call up a local business, ask them what they need, figure out how you can help get the word around, maybe order some food, order a book, or do something like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne more thing here, speaking of small businesses, let's talk a little bit about some of the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-to-save-your-small-businesses-from-coronavirus/\\u0022\\u003esupport that is available for small businesses\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Right. Are you referring to the Paycheck Protection Program?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That's right, you bet I am!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nYvonne Garand\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Okay, the PPP! This is really relevant to small business owners. The PPP, or Paycheck Protection Program, was part of the CARES stimulus package that the government created to try and uplift small businesses. The whole purpose of the PPP was to provide a potentially forgiven loan to small businesses. If a certain amount of those loan proceeds is used to keep employees on payroll or bring people back on payroll, then a certain portion of that loan is forgiven and the small business doesn't have to repay that loan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stimulus package came out a month or so ago with $349 billion dollars, and it dried up quickly. I want to share with everyone that we are a certified SBA lender, which means if you own a small business, or you know someone who owns a small business, and you're looking for cash flow or looking for an opportunity to keep your employees on payroll, please contact us and learn more about this potentially forgiven loan program.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may have seen in the media that the program was beat up a little bit because the intent of the program was really to help the small businesses in our nation. We know in Vermont, small businesses are really the fabric, the backbone, of our economy. A couple of companies have gotten beaten up over this because larger corporations took advantage of these loans through big banks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will publicly commit to everyone listening here: We are 100% committed to helping small mom and pop shops, small businesses in Vermont. If you need help, please contact us. And contact us quickly, because just like in the first phase, we know that the money dries up pretty quickly. The government, luckily, got back together and refunded the program. So, the dollars are available. Please contact us, and let's see if we can help you and your small business.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Yeah, that's a great thing. Thanks for sharing that, Yvonne. I know we've been working hard on getting those out to everybody. It's great to spread the news a little bit wider.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we conclude today, I wanted to just to share a little bit about unemployment. Of course, you can still file for unemployment. If you are feeling like you don’t want to file for unemployment because it reflects badly on you to ask for help, it doesn’t. It doesn't reflect on you at all. It's okay to ask for help. You can file for unemployment with the Vermont Department of Labor. They're filling claims as fast as they can. That's labor.vermont.gov. Because of COVID, some of the rules and regulations, some of the conditions that you had to already meet to apply, have been loosened.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also have our very own and unique Member Emergency Loan. This is a 24-month loan for up to $2,000. It has a very, very unique interest rate of zero percent. And there's all kinds of things that are going into providing that interest rate to you, including work by the Vermont Community Foundation, the VSECU giving committee, and some other really important partners that are helping us out with bringing that interest rate down.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the things that people may not know is that if you are a child education worker, a younger childhood education worker, and you have been affected, there's some additional benefits that Let’s Grow Kids is providing you through this Member Emergency Loan. So, get in touch with us. You can actually head to our COVID-19 landing page www.vsecu.com/covid-19 that has all kinds of resources about that for you. And I'm going to share one other...\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had this design that we made a couple of weeks ago of a physical distancing cow, a guide for all Vermonters. You can now buy it as a sticker, and 100% of the proceeds of all the money that you spend on those stickers goes to supporting that zero percent interest rate and actually helping members like you and other people in the community.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eYvonne\\u003c/strong\\u003e: This is the foundation of credit unions. We are all about people helping people. What a great way of mobilizing our own members, or non-members, to purchase the sticker. If it continues to grow in popularity, maybe we'll start making t-shirts or other swag. 100% of the monies that come in are going right back into that Member Emergency Loan that Oliver talked about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\r\\nOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Lots of cool stuff out there right now. So, thank you so much, Yvonne. This was a lot of fun! Of course if you have any questions for us out there in the public, feel free to give us a call. You can also send us an email at info@vsecu.com. If you want to get right in touch with a couple of us, you can go to our Facebook page, send us a message on Facebook. Let us know what's going on. Let us know how we can help you, and we'll do everything that we can in our power.\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66ec19ca5d494\"} /-->",

Within those inquiries, we’re noticing a few common myths that have arisen, so we decided to post a follow-up article to clear up some of these myths. If you haven’t read the original blog, make sure to take a look if you don’t find the answers to your questions below.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMyth #1: I will have to pay taxes on the money I receive.\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nThis is not true. The IRS has designated the stimulus funds as tax credits, not taxable income. Rest assured that you can use this money in whatever way you want, and you won't have to pay any tax on it in 2020.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMyth #2: I will have to pay back the stimulus money.\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nAlso, not true. You won't have to pay back the money you receive from the IRS next tax season, assuming you filed correctly in 2018 or 2019. In-fact, you may actually receive more money back when you file your 2020 taxes according to the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://taxfoundation.org/federal-coronavirus-relief-bill-cares-act/\\u0022 rel=\\u0022 noopener\\u0022\\u003eTax Foundation\\u003c/a\\u003e! Even if your adjusted gross income is higher in 2020 than it was in 2018 or 2019, you still won't have to pay back the stimulus money.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMyth #3: Because the IRS sent me a larger check than I deserved, I will have to pay back the extra.\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nIf you receive more money than you were supposed to get, the IRS will not ask for the money back. If you receive a call asking to pay back the difference, it is likely a scam according to the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/04/coronavirus-checks-flattening-scam-curve\\u0022\\u003eFederal Trade Commission\\u003c/a\\u003e.

Head to the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments\\u0022\\u003eEconomic Impact Payment web page\\u003c/a\\u003e on the IRS website and scroll down. Click the button that says \\u0022Non-filers: Enter Payment Info Here.\\u0022 You'll be able to enter your information and receive your stimulus money, just like those who filed in 2018 or 2019.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eMyth #5: If my tax situation has changed since I filed my taxes, there’s nothing I can do about it.\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\nIf you have not filed your 2019 taxes yet, and your tax situation has changed since you filed your 2018 taxes (one common change is the birth of a child), the amount of stimulus money you receive will not reflect your changed tax situation until you have filed your 2019 return. If you file your 2019 taxes after you have received your stimulus money, you may have to wait until you file your 2020 taxes to receive a corrected tax credit based on your current tax situation. The IRS is still working to clarify gray areas like these. Keep an eye on the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments\\u0022\\u003eEconomic Impact Payment web page\\u003c/a\\u003e on the IRS website for updated information.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nThose are the common myths and there’s one final frequent question that I don’t have a clear answer for. If you receive your tax refund on a prepaid card, such as an H\\u0026amp;R Block Emerald card, it's unclear whether money will be deposited on your card. The best advice I can give is that you head to the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments\\u0022\\u003eEconomic Impact Payment web page\\u003c/a\\u003e on the IRS website and click the button that says \\u0022Get My Payment.\\u0022 There, you'll be able to track your stimulus and update your information if necessary.\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"row_background_color\":\"white\",\"_row_background_color\":\"field_5e2f5d26eaae3\",\"horizontal_rule\":\"0\",\"_horizontal_rule\":\"field_5989fb5734d75\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66b2646178322\"} /-->",

This interview has been edited for clarity.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: We are coming to you live from VSECU headquarters here in Montpelier. Welcome to everyone joining us! We’re going to be talking about how to keep you and your money safe over the coming weeks. We’re joined today by our \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/author/tfield/\\u0022\\u003eCFO and Senior Vice President of Finance, Terence Field\\u003c/a\\u003e. Welcome Terry!\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Thanks Oliver, thanks for having me!\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: And I, by the way, am Oliver Ames. I’m the social media specialist here at VSECU. We thought it might be helpful to address the questions surrounding our response to the coronavirus (COVID-19). What we’ve done here is compiled a list of questions that we have received from members and that we’ve been hearing out in the world.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Sure.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: So right off the bat, let’s talk a little bit about how VSECU has responded and how we’re making sure staff and members are safe.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Our number one priority is member and staff safety. As soon as this started to become active about a week and a half ago now, we formed a pandemic planning team. Of course, we have a general disaster recovery and business continuity plan that incorporates a pandemic plan within it, so we activated that and started meeting on a regular basis.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: What we’ve been telling our staff is exactly what our members are hearing from the CDC and the World Health Organization. Wash your hands; stay social distanced; if you feel sick, stay home; don’t go to your doctor, call your doctor; and things like that. We have also increased cleaning at all of our facilities when we can. The cleaners come in regularly and do deep cleaning and disinfecting every night. We have also been able to get supplies for staff such as hand sanitizer.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: One of the things that we have been saying internally is to be prepared, not scared. The reality is that Vermont, compared to how many cases we have, has been on the ball in responding to this outbreak. Simple things like washing your hands, coughing in your elbow if you need to cough or sneeze, and reducing the amount of contact you have with the public are all good ways to stay safe. I think what we are seeing here is the community values that Vermont has and that we here at VSECU try to embody.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: As much as we work with our staff, we also want to work with our members to keep both safe.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Let’s talk about personal finances and banking. What are some of the ways people can do their banking remotely?\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: We have lots of options for members to do their banking remotely. Of course the obvious one is our \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/locations-atms/\\u0022\\u003eATMs\\u003c/a\\u003e. You can do deposits and withdrawals at all our ATMs. Also frequently used is \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/personal/online-mobile-banking/\\u0022\\u003eOnline Banking\\u003c/a\\u003e. You can go online and look at your accounts, perform transfers, and more. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/personal/online-mobile-banking/\\u0022\\u003eMobile banking\\u003c/a\\u003e is great too, because you can do almost all of the same functions on your phone as you can online. You can also call in and do transfers, deposit checks, check balances, and more. Of course, we have debit cards and credit cards which enable you to do most of your transactions without using cash. You can talk to people here in Montpelier by calling our Contact Center to apply for a loan, check balances, do transfers, and things like that. We even have bank by mail! You could send us something in the mail, and we’ll process it for you and send you a receipt if that’s what you’d like. You can apply for a loan online too. So, we have lots of options for members to continue doing their banking, doing their work with their credit union, without coming into the branch.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I was reading a few articles recently that talked about using \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/personal/online-mobile-banking/how-to-use-app/\\u0022\\u003econtactless payments\\u003c/a\\u003e as a way to reduce touchpoints. Many of our cards are contactless cards. If you are concerned about swiping your card through a terminal for gas or something like that, a lot of merchants now allow contactless payments where you can wave your card in front of the reader, and that will process the transaction for you.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I forgot to mention drive-through banking! We have that availability at our Montpelier, Williston, Berlin, and Rutland branches. So again, members don’t have to leave their car, and they can do their banking through the drive-through tubes. In our Williston, Berlin, and Rutland offices we have what we call video teller services. If you haven’t seen it, it is kind of like an indoor drive-through. You have a private, safe space where you can go, and it’s just you talking to the member service consultant on a little screen. You can do cash withdrawals and other transactions that way.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: We have also deployed video teller services in five of our branches where members can go in, tap the screen, and talk to a member service consultant here in Montpelier who will process your transactions for you. You can do deposits, withdrawals, transfers, loan payments, and ask questions.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: What are some ways that people can keep themselves safe right now from scammers and fraud?\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. VSECU is never going to call you and ask for your account number, your social security, your pin, or anything like that. The only time you will be asked for your personal information is if you initiate a call with our Contact Center. We will then go through the normal verification process to make sure we can identify you so that we can process your transaction safely. If you are getting a call from someone and you didn’t initiate it, you should be very suspicious. Also be very suspicious of unsolicited emails, especially ones that ask you to click on a link. Unfortunately, there are a lot of bad actors out there that are trying to take money away from our members. We have two people in our fraud department, and they deal with this on a regular basis.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: My advice to members is to be particularly cautious, especially now. Be cautious of emails you are getting. If you don’t know who sent it, don’t even open it, just delete it. And again, if you’re getting phone calls, don’t give out your personal information. If you think someone calling you might be VSECU, please contact us, and we can verify that for you.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: What would you say to members who are worried about accessing their money if things get worse?\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: We’ve talked about all the different ways of getting to your money, so I do not think getting to your money is ever going to be a problem. We have lots of ways for members to do business with us.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I think about money in two ways: there is physical cash and then there is everything that you have at VSECU, which is not necessarily in cash. I’ve talked to a few members already who are worried about getting cash. We order cash on a regular basis; we monitor our cash levels. We track how much cash we use, and in times like this, if we are seeing an uptick in cash, we’ll order more to be able to meet supply. We aren’t going to over order, however. My point to members is that taking cash out of the Credit Union is not safe. The safest place for your money right now is in the Credit Union. We have controls, we have insurance, we have vaults, we have procedures, and we work with armored car companies. This is what we do, and this is what we’re good at. So, for the members who are thinking, “Well I’m going to take out an extra several thousand dollars,” I would encourage you to talk to us first. I don’t think it is a good idea. I’ve talked to some members who say, “I have a vault in my house.” The reality is that you do not have the vault systems that we have. You do not have the insurance that we have. You do not have the alarm systems that we have. I am very confident that we will be able to meet your cash needs now and in the future.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: The banking system in the United States is one of the strongest in the world and the Federal Reserve Bank has clearly stepped in to do whatever they need to do to maintain this banking system. We have a lot of resources available to us to draw on if we need to bring in more liquidity. I’m talking about being able to fund check clearings and things like that. We have a lot of capacity to do that.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: What does it mean to be federally insured?\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: The National Credit Union Administration, they are our insurer. They insure our members’ accounts. All members accounts are insured up to $250,000. If you have more than $250,000 on deposit with us, talk to us. We can help you. There are strategies that we may be able to deploy to help get more insurance. For the vast majority of members, $250,000 is going to be plenty of insurance. This institution, in the thirty years that I’ve been here, has never had a year where we have lost money.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: That’s significant!\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e. It is! We have a very strong capital position. What is capital? Think of capital like your rainy-day fund. Capital is the money that we have set aside over the last, almost seventy-five years now, in the event that something happens like this. We have about seventy million dollars in capital. That is a substantial amount of money. If you take an average year for us, our net income is about three million dollars. Let’s say we made zero dollars in 2020. That is extremely unlikely, but let’s just say that. That means we would have to draw down three million dollars of that seventy million dollars. We’d still have sixty-seven million dollars left and would still be considered well-capitalized. Now that’s an example; it is extremely unlikely that is going to happen. My point to members is that we have a lot of resources. We are a safe institution and have the NCUA insurance fund. That’s what I would tell members if they are really feeling concerned about the banking system and taking cash out. I’m happy to talk to members about this too, because I want them to understand that we are a very safe and sound financial institution and that taking out large amounts of cash just isn’t safe.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: What are some other dangers of taking large sums of money out of your accounts?\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Well, you’ve got to transport it, and I cannot help you once you leave our facilities. I can tell you that when you are behind these walls, I know how safe you are. I know the controls we have in place. I know the alarm systems. I know the vaults. I know the insurance. I know what we do to keep your money safe. Once you leave here, I cannot help you. I do not know what is going on out in that world. As we were talking about earlier, there are a lot of bad actors out there. Not just from the fraud standpoint, but there are people, and I hate to say this, that would knock you over for five dollars, let alone for $50,000. Also keep in mind that if you are storing cash at your house, which I think is a very bad idea, it isn’t just you that you are putting at risk. You are putting other people in that home at risk. If you are in an apartment building, you are putting other people in that apartment building at risk. Effectively, what I have told people is that you are putting the community at risk. If, god forbid, somebody should get robbed, that money is now on the black market. Someone is going to, and I hate to say this, buy drugs and guns with that, and that isn’t good for the community.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: What would you recommend members do right now with their money?\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I would encourage members to keep their money here and to not take out more than what they need. I do not recommend people carry a lot of cash on them. If you are feeling the need to take some cash out, do it in an orderly process and spread it out over a period. Don’t come in here and think that you are going to take out $50,000 cash. First of all, we probably wouldn’t have it, because we try not to maintain that much on hand at one time. If we get to that point, we’ll ask you to spread it out over time. That lowers the risk a little bit. Three weeks from now we may be in a totally different environment. You may say, “I don’t want this cash, I want to put it all back here because I feel perfectly fine with what is going on in the banking system.” Or you might say, “I’ve gotten scared, and I don’t want to have this all in my house.” So, spread it out and do it gradually.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Can you talk about what it means to operate on the same days as the Federal Reserve Bank?\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: The Federal Reserve Bank has a calendar that they publish each year that details all the holidays that they are going to be closed. There is an expectation, because we are a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, that we are going to be open when they are open. If we aren’t, we need to notify them. They are expecting us to come in every day, take those checks and transfers, and clear them against our members’ accounts. When the Federal Reserve Bank is open, we’re open, we’re doing business, we’re clearing members’ checks, we’re accepting their electronic payments, and we’re getting cash orders.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Let’s talk a little bit about how credit unions are particularly resilient to changes in the economy.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I think one of the biggest differences between us and the large commercial banks is the size of the deals that they are willing to take on. They are looking at fifty million dollars to one-hundred million dollar deals and loans. This means they are taking on a lot of risk. While these types of loans may be important for the state, and important for the economy, they don’t fit in our marketplace. That is the biggest difference between credit unions and big commercial banks. They are looking at bigger deals and taking on bigger credit risk.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: What should someone do if they are worried about paying their bills?\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Well, I’ll start with us of course. If you have a loan with us, or a credit card, and you know right off the bat that you are going to be under stress to make those payments, call us. The most important thing when dealing with a situation like this is communication. We cannot help you if you don’t talk to us. I encourage all members, and this doesn’t just apply to us but also to other vendors you work with, to talk to us. In a lot of cases, these businesses are going to be more than willing to work with you to work out payment arrangements. We try to be as flexible as we can when working with members to help them through times like this. This isn’t the first time that we have seen our members struggle to make loan payments. So, talk to your creditors. Talk to us, talk to other people you owe money, and get ahead of it.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Can you tell me about our skip-a-pay program?\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: We do have a Skip-a-Pay program. It isn’t something we do a lot of marketing about, but it is something I would encourage members to talk to us and call us about.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: You can call us any time and we’ll help talk you through all the resources that we have available. If you are experiencing issues with continued income, visit \\u003ca href=\\u0022http://labor.vermont.gov/\\u0022 rel=\\u0022 noopener\\u0022\\u003elabor.vermont.gov\\u003c/a\\u003e to see if there are any benefits that the state can provide you at this time. There have been some changes in policies due to COVID-19 that may affect you.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: This is a very dynamic situation. It is changing daily, if not by the hour. I would encourage members to go to resources like these and look at them frequently. Things will be continually changing over the coming weeks.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: We recommend the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.healthvermont.gov/\\u0022\\u003eVermont Health website\\u003c/a\\u003e, the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html\\u0022 rel=\\u0022 noopener\\u0022\\u003eCDC website\\u003c/a\\u003e, and the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019\\u0022 rel=\\u0022 noopener\\u0022\\u003eWorld Health Organization website\\u003c/a\\u003e. While we are trying to give you the best information possible, we aren’t the experts when it comes to health and wellness.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Let’s talk about the near zero percent interest rate that has been announced recently.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: The Federal Reserve Bank has been very proactive during this crisis. They acted on 3/15 by lowering the Federal Fund’s rate to a range between zero and twenty-five basis points. They’ll probably try to manage it as close to zero as they can. Twenty-five basis points converts to one quarter of one percent. They brought the rate down to make liquidity available in the banking system.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Can you define what liquidity is?\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Liquidity is not cash; it is my ability to get funds as I need them. For instance, I might sell mortgages on the secondary market, and that generates liquidity. I might sell investments, and that generates liquidity. So that liquidity coming back to me is money I have here for settlements. Say I need ten million dollars next week to cover check clearing because members are writing lots of checks. I might go out and sell some investments, the money from which goes into our settlement account. As checks come in, they get cleared and merchants get paid. The Federal Reserve Bank is working very hard across the country to keep liquidity in the system to make sure that banks and credit unions can continue to loan, they can continue to fund withdrawals if members need cash, they can continue to fund checks that are clearing, continue funding credit cards, and those sorts of things.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: We have a roughly sixty million dollar investment portfolio, which may sound like a lot, but when you are close to $850 million in assets, it’s a small percentage. My investment target is about ten percent of our assets. This is one of our primary tools to manage our liquidity. If I have excess liquidity when members are bringing in money, if I’m not loaning it out, I’m investing it.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: As a result of the rate cut, we are going to be earning a lot less on our investments. Consequently, we aren’t going to be able to pay as much on our deposits. We will need to be proactive in managing our cost to funds. And you’ll see that on the other side of the balance sheet too. We’ll have to be more accommodating on the loan side too. These two things don’t necessarily work in tandem however. In other words, if the Federal Reserve Bank cuts the Fed Fund by seventy-five basis points, you won’t see a loan rate come down seventy-five basis points, but you will certainly see some changes. All financial institutions are going to be looking hard at their deposit rates, looking hard at their loan rates, and seeing where they can help their members, or their customers, while also recognizing they have to lower their deposit rates.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: You wrote a great blog post a few weeks ago about how the Federal Reserve Bank impacts interest rates. \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-are-interest-rates-determined-by-financial-institutions/\\u0022\\u003eYou can find that here\\u003c/a\\u003e!\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: For those that don’t follow it as closely as I do, that isn’t the only thing the Federal Reserve Bank is doing. For example, they have been very involved in the overnight repo market. They have been literally pumping billions of dollars into the overnight repo market to keep it liquid. Members need to be aware, and I’m sure they are from watching the news, that the federal government is working very hard to create some stimulus. All of these things are going to help us down the road. It may not feel like it right now, but we will eventually get over this. There are a lot of things going on that the economy will benefit from, and our members will benefit from, down the road.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Wonderful! Let’s end on a brief word about the economy.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: The first thing I would tell the members is that the stock market is not the economy. If you go back a month-and-a-half or two months, we would be talking about low unemployment, low inflation, and relatively modest growth. We were really in a sweet spot. Now we’ve pivoted. Now this crisis is upon us. It has certainly changed things a lot, but I think we will get back to where we were. It will take time, and it is going to be painful for a lot of people, you’re right. A lot of business have closed. I don’t think we’ve felt the full impact of this yet, and it’ll definitely ripple through the economy. Overall, my personal feeling is that the core economy was good going in, and I think it can be recovered. I like the things that the Federal Reserve Bank is doing. I like the things I hear from the federal government in terms of creating stimulus, and I think it will help eventually. This is a rough patch, but I think we will come out the other side. I think eventually you’ll see those stock numbers go up; you’ll just have to be patient.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Now of course we are not financial advisers….\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: No, we are not.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: If you have additional concerns, please talk to one of our member service consultants and they can help you find the resources to help you navigate the economy. Anything else you want to share Terry?\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eTerry\\u003c/strong\\u003e: I appreciate the opportunity, Oliver, to talk to you. Hopefully members are listening to this and again, I agree with you. If they have questions, please contact us, and I’m happy to talk to members any time about this stuff.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eOliver\\u003c/strong\\u003e: Fantastic!

As any new homeowners would, we have been nervously, excitedly, painting walls and undertaking little projects to make our home perfect for us, but the first big project now looms on the horizon—the heating system.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe need: a new home heating system\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nWhen we bought the house, we knew that the first big thing we’d need to do was to replace our ancient, 1985 oil furnace with a modern solution for heating in the winter. Fuel providers estimated we’d make it through the winter but told us to seriously start budgeting for a new oil furnace and a new oil tank in the spring. Plus, every time the fan turns on to heat the house it makes a loud clank and scares the dog right off her bed!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe dream: low-carbon, renewable pellets!\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nHaving heard so much about \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/use-wood-to-create-an-efficient-heating-system\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003epellet furnaces\\u003c/a\\u003e, I immediately started dreaming about getting one to slot right into the place of our current oil furnace (because of the layout of our home, a pellet stove is not something we're able to install). A few local companies deliver pellets to our area using a truck that looks an awful lot like an oil truck, the pellets are made in Vermont, the price of pellets is relatively stable compared to other options, they reduce the United States’ reliance on foreign oil, and their environmental impact is lower than that of fossil fuel alternatives. Plus, we’d be getting rid of a weeping oil tank and transitioning our heating to a \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/energy-efficient-home-heating-options/\\u0022\\u003esustainable alternative\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe question: does this make financial sense?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nAs I started doing my research, I began to have some serious questions about whether a pellet furnace was right for us. The biggest setback was the cost of the initial installation and equipment. A quote put the cost at roughly $17,000, even after $6,000 dollars of incentives. That meant that it would take us several years to start seeing any financial gain from pellets. Will we still be in this house after all those years? We’re not sure; and this is a big investment that we want to make sure is right for us.\\n\\nAfter a few hours of research (and five emails to my poor fuel provider at 9:30 PM), I found this handy \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.pelletheat.org/compare-fuel-costs\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003efuel cost calculator\\u003c/a\\u003e at \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.pelletheat.org/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 rel=\\u0022noopener\\u0022\\u003epelletheat.org\\u003c/a\\u003e. It lets you input the cost of various fuel types alongside the efficiency of the products you’re looking at, then gives you an estimate of how much it’ll cost to heat a standard volume of air.*\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe reality: a pellet furnace isn't right for me\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nSo, I went about entering product efficiencies and estimated costs to see what I’d potentially save. I used our \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/financial/home-loans/heating\\u0022\\u003eVHeat fuel pricing\\u003c/a\\u003e as a basis for my oil and propane costs and some high efficiency furnaces—one oil and one propane—for the efficiency percentage. It is important to note here that VHeat is not available everywhere in Vermont, so you may want to use a different source for your calculations, such as the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Legislative-Reports/2020-Annual-202be-report-Final_withCoverLetter.pdf\\u0022 rel=\\u0022 noopener\\u0022\\u003eVermont 2020 Annual Energy Report\\u003c/a\\u003e. For pellets, I based my estimates on the abovementioned, $17,000 furnace (after incentives). I estimated $300 per ton of delivered pellets with an appliance efficiency of 87.7% (I found this statistic on the manufacturer’s website). The result was that per one standard volume of air, it would cost $20.86 to heat using pellets, $17.98 to heat with oil, and $22.75 to heat with propane (numbers as of early February, 2020).\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cimg class=\\u0022aligncenter\\u0022 src=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png?width=713\\u0026amp;name=Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png\\u0022 sizes=\\u0022(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px\\u0022 srcset=\\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png?width=357\\u0026amp;name=Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png 357w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png?width=713\\u0026amp;name=Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png 713w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png?width=1070\\u0026amp;name=Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png 1070w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png?width=1426\\u0026amp;name=Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png 1426w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png?width=1783\\u0026amp;name=Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png 1783w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png?width=2139\\u0026amp;name=Annotation%202020-02-04%20104024.png 2139w\\u0022 alt=\\u0022Annotation 2020-02-04 104024\\u0022 width=\\u0022713\\u0022 /\\u003e\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nNot to be deceived by one source, I did some more calculations to compare what we pay now to what we might pay with a pellet furnace. I found a few resources online that suggested that one ton of pellets roughly equates to 120 gallons of oil (\\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.woodpellets.com/support/fuel-savings-calculator.aspx\\u0022 rel=\\u0022 noopener\\u0022\\u003ewoodpellets.com\\u003c/a\\u003e is one of them). Since our house takes 360 gallons of oil per year, it would mean that we’d likely need about three tons of wood pellets to heat our home throughout the winter. We do not currently use oil to heat our water, and we plan to keep this separate from our space heating, so your numbers may be radically different. Using our current VHeat pricing of $2.42 per gallon of oil, I estimated it would cost us roughly $630 a year to heat our home. If I used the same cost per ton of pellets I used in my previous equation, it would cost $900 a year to heat our home using pellets.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nThe other thing to contend with is that right now we have oil delivered for heating and propane delivered for our gas fireplace, dryer, and stove. This means that even if we were to replace oil with wood pellets, we’re still paying for propane. When I mentioned this to a friend who is knowledgeable about heating systems, he said that it’s a good rule of thumb to use just one fuel source in your home so you aren’t dependent on two different fluctuating prices and two different deliveries. Cutting your fuel deliveries to one vendor really helps simplify things, especially in rural areas. Unfortunately we can’t get rid of the propane easily, because we’d also have to replace three appliances. The price just keeps adding up!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe decision: i'll keep dreaming of a more affordable, sustainable option\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nSo, although I am still dreaming about our renewable energy future, it’s unlikely that my wife and I will install a pellet furnace. We desperately want to, but the numbers just don’t add up for us right now. The most efficient propane furnace we can find is still significantly less than $10,000, even after installation, and we already have a propane tank sitting outside. We can still get rid of the oil tank, and although we’ll be burning fossil fuels, we’ll be very efficiently doing so (95% efficiency is nothing to be sneezed at).\\n\\nThe reality is that clean energy solutions, like pellets furnaces, aren’t yet cheap enough for some people, even after the significant incentives. The high upfront cost and the price of delivery is much more expensive than a traditional alternative and is not guaranteed to add to the sale price of your home if you plan on selling one day. Depending on your home and your financial situation, there may be other efficiencies to consider before investing in a pellet furnace, such as weatherization, which can have a major impact on your overall fuel cost and carbon footprint. If you do make energy upgrades to your home and plan on selling, be sure to check out the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.appraisalinstitute.org/education/education-resources/green-building-resources/\\u0022 rel=\\u0022 noopener\\u0022\\u003eAppraisal Institute\\u003c/a\\u003e for resources that may help you get more for your investment.\\n\\nHonestly though, I hope the price comes down over time because heating with local wood pellets just sounds like a dream come true. For some, that dream is already here! For us, it’s a few years down the road. If I was building a house from scratch tomorrow, I'd take a closer look at all my fuel options and possibly install a pellet-based heating system. But for our house and wallets? That’s a much harder case to make.\\n\\n*For those more interested in this, the calculator actually calculates the cost per million British thermal units (BTUs). A BTU is typically defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

In an age of social network and merchant-data breaches, how could putting your card information into your phone be more secure than using a plastic card?\\n\\nWhenever you make a purchase, your phone sends a unique transaction code and a special number (or device identifier) that is unique to your mobile wallet. This means your card number is never stored on your device and the merchant doesn’t know your card number.

Your phone should be protected with biometric security (fingerprint or facial scan) and/or a passcode to ensure nobody breaks into it to access your wallet.\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/td\\u003e\\n\\u003c/tr\\u003e\\n\\u003c/tbody\\u003e\\n\\u003c/table\\u003e\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nBut what happens if someone took your phone? Most modern phones have several layers of protection to keep them safe from bad actors. Biometric security, like your fingerprint or facial scan, keep people out of your phone who aren’t you. Even if you only use a six-digit passcode on your phone, there are one million possible passcodes! To make storing information even more secure, many modern phones, like the Apple iPhone or the Google Pixel, have special chips that isolate your device identifier and transaction code generator from the rest of the system. That means that even if you installed a virus on your phone, it would be physically isolated from that secure information.\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eIn Summary:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Your account number/card number is never stored on your phone and when you pay, card numbers are never shared with merchants.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow convenient are contactless payments?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nNow that you can rest easy knowing that paying with your phone is one of the most secure ways to pay, it’s time to talk about convenience. As more and more people upgrade to modern smartphones and the technology becomes an integral part of our daily lives, the likelihood that you’ll have a phone in your hand when you’re out buying lunch or shopping for the holidays is very likely. This means you never have to dig for a big bulky wallet when you are standing at the register. Just pull out your phone where you have all your credit and debit cards, rewards cards, health insurance cards, vouchers, bus tickets, and plane tickets. They’re all in one place, easy to access, and ready to go.\\n\\nThe other benefit? You don’t have to wait for your transaction to process. With chip cards, you have to insert the card into the card reader, wait for it to be read (if they’re even read the first time), enter more information, and then wait for a horribly grating buzz to tell you your transaction is done. All you need do with a mobile wallet is wave it quickly at the machine and you’re done. When I use Apple Pay at stores here in Montpelier, often the cashier doesn’t even realize I’ve already paid—it goes so fast!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003ePro tip:\\u003c/strong\\u003e for those of you who have an Apple Watch, you don’t even need to pull back the sleeve of your coat to have the watch send its unique transaction ID and device identifier to the retailer. Try this for yourself and have people look at you with wonder as you wave your coat sleeve over a register and walk out.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCan a mobile wallet make traveling easier?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nTraveling with a mobile wallet is a fantastic experience, especially if you plan on taking public transportation. While most people end up waiting in line to get a subway card or train ticket once they’ve arrived at their destination, nearly every major city accepts mobile wallets. This means you get to skip the line, go right to the turnstiles, waive your phone at the pad, and you’re in! I used this every single day while traveling in London and never had to purchase an \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_card\\u0022\\u003eOyster Card\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\n\\nSpeaking of traveling abroad, mobile wallets in other countries are extremely convenient. The UK and Japan have reached nearly 100% adoption of contactless payments, meaning you can pay for everything, from a fancy meal in a restaurant to sending a few bucks to a busker on the street. Plus, the added security of using a mobile wallet means some banks don’t even need you to submit a travel notice!\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003ePro tip:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Some financial institutions can remotely send new payment information to your phone if you lose your physical card and need a new one fast. Instead of waiting for the new card to arrive in the mail and get activated, ask your financial institution if they can activate that card in advance in your mobile wallet! This is great for traveling if you lose a card or wallet but still need to pay.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWho takes mobile wallets?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nPretty much everyone takes Apple Pay or Google Pay today, from small businesses and farmer’s markets to grocery chains and everything in between. Even if a business does not say they accept Apple Pay, modern point-of-sale machines all take contactless payments. Look for this symbol, a glowing green light on the register, or ask the clerk if they take contactless payments.\\n\\nSometimes the clerk will say no, I’ll waive my phone at the register, and voila, the clerk was simply unaware that the machine could take my mobile wallet!\\n\\nThere are some holdouts and late adopters of mobile wallets though. While some gas stations take contactless payments at the pump, most do not (although you can usually pay inside). Restaurants—mainly those that bring your check to the table—are not yet suited to offering payments via your phone.\\n\\nYou can also use mobile payments online. The most widely accepted wallet is Apple Wallet/Apple Pay which is accepted at most big retailers and uses the same security as if you were paying in person (described above). Security is needed even more online, thanks to the fact that you are typing in your card number into a web form if you choose not to use a mobile wallet.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003ePro tip:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Scroll down for a list of places local to Montpelier that I’ve seen accept mobile wallets.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eConclusion\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nIn some countries, contactless payments have reached nearly 100% saturation. While the United States has been slow to pick up on the trend, contactless payments are getting more popular thanks to their convenience and security. Even if you don’t plan on using your mobile wallet regularly, it is still a great thing to try and be comfortable with in-case you leave your wallet at home. I think if you try it, you’ll love it!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\u003cstrong\\u003eA few places I’ve used Apple Pay in Montpelier\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eHunger Mountain Co-op\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eShaws\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eDunkin Donuts\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eCumberland Farms\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eWalgreens\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eAubuchon Hardware\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eCapitol Grounds\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eAlla Vita\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eSubway\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eBlue Stone\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eBirchgrove Baking\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eMeadow Mart\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eYankee Wine \\u0026amp; Spirits\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n \\t\\u003cli\\u003eWayside Restaurant \\u0026amp; Bakery\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"row_background_color\":\"white\",\"_row_background_color\":\"field_5e2f5d26eaae3\",\"horizontal_rule\":\"0\",\"_horizontal_rule\":\"field_5989fb5734d75\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66b2646178322\"} /-->",

In auditing how our house deals with heating over the past few chilly weeknights, we realized we wanted a better way to control the heat, while also saving on fuel oil!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhy we chose a smart thermostat\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nOne recommendation that kept popping up was to buy and install a \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.efficiencyvermont.com/is-smart-thermostat-worth-buying\\u0022\\u003esmart thermostat\\u003c/a\\u003e. Unlike traditional, or even programmable thermostats, smart thermostats automatically create temperature schedules based on when you typically get home, go to bed, and wake up. Basically, each time you adjust the heat in the house, you teach the thermostat what your heating habits are, and it comes up with the most efficient way to heat your home.\\n\\nPerhaps a better name for a smart thermostat would be a \\u0022learning\\u0022 thermostat. Not only does it work to learn your routine, it also monitors how quickly it can heat your home! Using that information and your typical routine, this enables the thermostat to heat your house to exactly the right temperature—say when you are coming home from work—without heating it too early or too late. Heat the home too early and you waste energy heating an empty house. Heat the home to late and you'll be shivering for a few minutes at home.\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\nSome smart thermostats also come with little external sensors. These can be placed all around the house to detect the temperature of different rooms. Some of these sensors, like ones from \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/smart-thermostat-voice/\\u0022\\u003eEcobee\\u003c/a\\u003e, also detect room occupancy and can help the thermostat know if it should turn on the heat. Let's say I'm watching TV in the living room with my wife and we've got the gas fireplace on. Chances are, it's even hotter in the living room than the temperature I set on the thermostat! Luckily, the occupancy sensors in the other rooms around the house know that I'm not in them so the thermostat doesn't turn the heat on. It knows that the room I'm in is set to exactly the right temperature I want it to be so why waste heat warming up empty rooms?\\n\\nAnother thing that smart thermostats can do is connect to the internet using secure networking protocols. This lets you do things like adjust the temperature while you are at work or use voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri to control the temperature. One example of this awesome functionality comes into play every night. Instead of trying to remember if I turned the heat down at night and going downstairs, all cold, to check the thermostat, I simply say, \\u0022Alexa, Goodnight.\\u0022 The voice assistant then turns off all our lights (smart light switches), locks the doors (smart door locks), and sets the temperature to my preferred setting. It's like magic!\\n\\n\\u0026nbsp;\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022section post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-body\\u0022\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eThe cost of smart technology (and how you can pay less)\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\nBy now, I bet you are wondering just how expensive a smart thermostat is. Depending on what smart assistants you want it to work with (Amazon Alexa, Apple \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.amazon.com/s?k=homekit+smart+thermostat\\u0026amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6JKoyt7G5QIVCY_ICh00qA3ZEAAYASAAEgJskfD_BwE\\u0026amp;hvadid=323114689094\\u0026amp;hvdev=c\\u0026amp;hvlocphy=9003055\\u0026amp;hvnetw=g\\u0026amp;hvpos=1t1\\u0026amp;hvqmt=e\\u0026amp;hvrand=2993887975419789923\\u0026amp;hvtargid=kwd-343544000382\\u0026amp;hydadcr=13987_9749196\\u0026amp;tag=googhydr-20\\u0026amp;ref=pd_sl_1ia7w7o8j_e\\u0022\\u003eHomekit\\u003c/a\\u003e, or Google \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://store.google.com/magazine/compare_thermostats?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImJXy1N_G5QIVA56fCh0gEwuhEAAYASAAEgKnwfD_BwE\\u0026amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\\u0022\\u003eNest\\u003c/a\\u003e), the cost will vary widely. The one my wife and I got was the \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/smart-thermostat-voice/\\u0022\\u003eEcobee SmartThermostat\\u003c/a\\u003e with voice control. It integrates with all the different smart home platforms so you don't get locked into one mega corporation's system, and it has Alexa built right in so it can do wild things like play music (the best party trick is having your thermostat play the Monster Mash during your Halloween party). It can also detect occupancy all on its own and comes with an additional sensor for you to place elsewhere in the house.\\n\\nThe best part of all of this? Efficiency Vermont offers a $100 \\u003ca href=\\u0022https://www.efficiencyvermont.com/rebates/list/smart-thermostats\\u0022\\u003ecash rebate\\u003c/a\\u003e if you buy a smart thermostat! So, if the $169 thermostat looks a little expensive, the rebate gets you down to $69 dollars, and that's a savings that you'll easily recoup over a few years of use and efficient heating. Worried about installation? On most systems it's a snap and all these companies offer customer support to help you out if you are nervous.\\n\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\u0022post\\u002d\\u002dsingle-author-section\\u0022\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\",\"_long-form_text_0_tm_content\":\"field_6261e075a1fd3\",\"long-form_text_0_link\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_link\":\"field_5cf03b9fd9763\",\"long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"0\",\"_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle\":\"field_5cf03bdad9764\",\"long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"\",\"_long-form_text_0_optional_button\":\"field_638fb38cc1e4d\",\"long-form_text\":1,\"_long-form_text\":\"field_6261dfe4a1fcf\",\"row_alignment\":\"justify-center\",\"_row_alignment\":\"field_610af955b60a5\",\"row_background_color\":\"white\",\"_row_background_color\":\"field_5e2f5d26eaae3\",\"horizontal_rule\":\"0\",\"_horizontal_rule\":\"field_5989fb5734d75\",\"content_block_anchor\":\"\",\"_content_block_anchor\":\"field_5984d175eaf00\",\"block_settings\":\"\",\"_block_settings\":\"field_62aa0ef7c0352\"},\"mode\":\"edit\",\"id\":\"acf-block-66b2646178322\"} /-->",
