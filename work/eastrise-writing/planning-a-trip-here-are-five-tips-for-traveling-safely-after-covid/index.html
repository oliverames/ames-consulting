The result is a declining number of positive COVID-19 cases and death rate, leading many states to slowly begin reopening. Here in Vermont, we currently \u003ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/GovPhilScott/status/1389181435651690498\u0022\u003erank first in the nation\u003c/a\u003e for the rate of vaccine administration!\n\nWith all this good news, it might soon be safe to travel again and perhaps reschedule that trip you canceled in 2020. In fact, \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/heres-what-post-pandemic-travel-might-look-like.html\u0022\u003eCNBC reports\u003c/a\u003e that 65% of Americans plan to travel more in 2021 than in years prior to COVID-19! Here are a few things to keep in mind as you plan your post-COVID adventures out in the world.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003ch2\u003eWhen not to travel\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends waiting to travel until you are fully vaccinated. For the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, that means two weeks after your second shot. For the Johnson \u0026amp; Johnson vaccine, that is two weeks after your single dose. If you haven’t been vaccinated yet but have to travel for unavoidable circumstances, see CDC recommendations for traveling \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html\u0022\u003edomestically\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html\u0022\u003einternationally\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nEven if you have been fully vaccinated, you should not travel with symptoms of COVID-19. You also should not travel if you think you might have been exposed to COVID-19. However, if you have been fully vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 in the past three months, you do not need to self-quarantine and can travel even after exposure.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n\u003cstrong style=\u0022color: #542437; font-size: calc(26px + 4 * ((100vw - 600px) / 680));\u0022\u003eWHAT TO DO WHEN YOU TRAVEL\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nThe most important thing during any type of travel, whether you are fully vaccinated or not, is to protect those around you by wearing a face mask. \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/surface-transmission.html\u0022\u003eAccording to the CDC\u003c/a\u003e, “The principal mode by which people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is through exposure to respiratory droplets carrying the infectious virus.” A face mask drastically reduces the likelihood you’ll spread COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses and is a courtesy that may remain for the next few years. Get a quality face mask or two and keep one on as much as possible! I personally hope that COVID-19 has helped reduce the stigma of wearing a mask so that everyone will take preventative measures even if they only have a common cold.\n\nWhen you travel, touching a lot of surfaces is unavoidable. \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/surface-transmission.html\u0022\u003eAccording to the CDC\u003c/a\u003e, “It is possible for people to be infected through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects…, but the risk is generally considered to be low.” The most important thing you can do to protect yourself from this low-risk transmission is to wash your hands frequently and try to reduce contact in highly trafficked areas.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to overcome a fear of traveling\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2020/11/10/post-covid-19-travel-41-people-worldwide-expect-to-travel-less-by-any-meansnew-research/?sh=203c66b35f67\u0022\u003eForbes reported\u003c/a\u003e that 41% of individuals are planning to travel much less after COVID-19. If you’re feeling anxious about traveling, \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/fear-flying-panic-attack-covid/\u0022\u003eyou’re clearly not alone\u003c/a\u003e! Here are a few ways to ease yourself back into it.\n\nTry smaller “practice” trips around where you live before leaping right into that cross-country flight you were planning in 2020. Or you can decide to travel to somewhere you’ve already been, rather immediately traveling somewhere completely foreign to you. If being around a number of other people is making you nervous, perhaps \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/heres-how-covid-is-changing-travel-according-to-the-experts\u0022\u003econsider a road trip\u003c/a\u003e! The United States is full of scenic drives and beautiful open spaces for you to explore via the comfort of your own car.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\u0022section post\u002d\u002dsingle-body\u0022\u003e\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003ch2\u003eWhen booking travel\u003c/h2\u003e\nAs you \u003ca href=\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/how-to-travel-on-a-budget\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 rel=\u0022noopener\u0022\u003eplan your next trip\u003c/a\u003e, think about unique destinations that might not be as crowded as the larger tourist traps. Often the road less traveled offers the most exquisite experiences and you’ll be far away from the big crowds of eager post-COVID travelers! A unique travel experience doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg, either. Think hiking in Canada or kayaking in Portland, Oregon!\n\nNow more than ever might be a wise time to purchase trip cancellation insurance. Due to COVID-19, the unpredictable nature of travel basically necessitates it! Last year, many people who opted out of trip cancellation insurance were unable to get refunds for trips they had booked prior to the pandemic. Many credit cards offer some level of protection, but if the vendor you purchase your tickets from offers a relatively affordable insurance option, it might be worth it! Trip cancellation insurance should cost \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.forbes.com/advisor/travel-insurance/best-cancel-for-any-reason-travel-insurance/#:~:text=Keep%20in%20mind%2C%20travel%20insurance,additional%20%24200%20for%20CFAR%20coverage.\u0022\u003eno more than between 5% and 10% of your total trip cost\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nNote that trip cancellation insurance is different from travel protection, which offers additional benefits like rental car damage, flight delays, lost luggage, and medical expenses. Some travel protection \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.forbes.com/advisor/travel-insurance/travel-protection-vs-insurance/\u0022\u003ealso includes basic trip cancellation coverage\u003c/a\u003e, so it is worth reading the fine print to determine which type of insurance is best for your needs.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat to expect for international travel\u003c/h2\u003e\nAs of May 5, \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 rel=\u0022noopener\u0022\u003eall air passengers boarding flights to the United States\u003c/a\u003e must show documentation of a negative COVID-19 test or of a recent COVID-19 recovery. This applies to U.S. citizens as well. There has been no additional clarification from the CDC about how this policy might change for vaccinated people. Rest assured, though, for the next few years \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.travelperk.com/blog/the-future-of-business-travel-after-covid19/\u0022\u003eyou can expect significantly extended lines at airport immigration\u003c/a\u003e and be required to carry more than just your passport and visa.\n\nI personally am excited to travel again, even with the potential risks. After being isolated in my neighborhood and eating the same food for over a year, I can’t wait to explore the world again. A silver lining of the new requirements for travel? You can bet everything is much cleaner!\n\n\u003c/div\u003e","_long-form_text_0_tm_content":"field_6261e075a1fd3","long-form_text_0_link":"","_long-form_text_0_link":"field_5cf03b9fd9763","long-form_text_0_ada_toggle":"0","_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle":"field_5cf03bdad9764","long-form_text_0_optional_button":"","_long-form_text_0_optional_button":"field_638fb38cc1e4d","long-form_text":1,"_long-form_text":"field_6261dfe4a1fcf","row_alignment":"justify-center","_row_alignment":"field_610af955b60a5","row_background_color":"white","_row_background_color":"field_5e2f5d26eaae3","horizontal_rule":"0","_horizontal_rule":"field_5989fb5734d75","content_block_anchor":"","_content_block_anchor":"field_5984d175eaf00","block_settings":"","_block_settings":"field_62aa0ef7c0352"},"mode":"edit","id":"acf-block-66b2646178322"} /-->
