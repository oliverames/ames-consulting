That means most people are living paycheck to paycheck, with little or no cushion for emergencies, let alone long-term goals. If you’re one of them, you might be wondering how to change that. How can you save more money and make it work for you?\r\n\r\nSaving money is not only a smart financial move, but also a way to improve your quality of life. Having savings provides stability, opens doors to major milestones, and gives you options. It can also reduce stress, increase happiness, and boost your confidence. However, saving money is not easy for many people. Many people don’t know what types of accounts are out there, how they differ, and what they are best used for. Some people think that saving money means sacrificing everything they enjoy, or that they need a lot of money to start saving. These are false beliefs that can hold you back from achieving your financial goals.\r\n\r\nIn this guide, we’ll explore common savings account types, their features, and ideal uses. We’ll also show you how to earn the most interest on your hard-earned savings while keeping your money accessible for future goals. Whether you’re saving for a rainy day, a big purchase, or retirement, this guide will help you find the best savings account for your needs.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ch2\u003eDefining key terms\u003c/h2\u003e\r\nFirst, let’s define a few key terms that banks use to describe savings accounts and their related features:\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eAPY or Annual Percentage Yield represents the total interest your account will earn in one year assuming compounding. This allows direct comparison of returns across account types.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eInterest compounds when it accrues on both your original deposits and previously earned interest. Compounding frequency impacts how quickly your money grows.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eMinimum balance is the lowest amount you’ll need to keep on deposit to earn interest and avoid monthly fees.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eLimitations reference how many withdrawals and transfers you can make monthly before incurring penalties.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow, let’s explore the most common savings vehicles.\r\n\r\n\u003cem style=\u0022font-size: 16px;\u0022\u003eThe rates listed in this blog were collected as of October 16, 2023. You can see current national averages by \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/national-rates/index.html#footnote\u0022\u003evisiting the FIDC’s website\u003c/a\u003e.

Traditional savings accounts provide flexibility to deposit and withdraw funds while earning a small amount of interest.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eInterest Rate/APY – . Rates are variable.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eMinimum Balance – Most banks don’t require one but may limit interest earning to balances over $300 - $500.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003ePerks – Easy to open, no lock-up period for funds.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese accounts provide complete flexibility, making them ideal for:\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eBuilding an emergency fund\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eAccumulating savings for intermittent expenses like medical bills or car repairs.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eSetting aside funds you may need quick access to.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile traditional savings accounts are accessible, their returns are lackluster. Savers looking to maximize interest should consider other options.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ch2\u003eHigh-yield savings accounts\u003c/h2\u003e\r\nHigh-yield savings provide the convenience of a savings account with amplified interest earning potential through higher rates – often 0.50% - 1.00% APY or more.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eInterest Rate/APY – High-yield accounts \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/#:~:text=The%20national%20average%20APY%20on,highest%2Dyield%20savings%20accounts%20offer.\u0022\u003eoffer APYs of up to 5% or more\u003c/a\u003e, if you shop around.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eMinimum Balance – Typically there is a set minimum balance required to earn the highest APY.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003ePerks – Higher returns while still allowing access to your money.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nBanks incentivize larger deposit balances with higher interest rates. In exchange, you’ll need to maintain significantly higher minimum balances. Uses for high-yield savings include:\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eBuilding an emergency fund quickly.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eAccumulating larger savings like a house down payment.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eMaximizing returns on excess cash not needed for daily spending.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nPro Tip: Compare offers from multiple banks and credit unions when choosing a high-yield savings account. Look for the highest APY with the lowest minimum balance requirement.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ch2\u003eMoney market accounts\u003c/h2\u003e\r\nMoney market accounts offer an attractive blend of savings account convenience with returns closer to short-term investment vehicles.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eInterest Rate/APY – These accounts provide similar returns to high-yield savings accounts, averaging \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/national-rates/index.html#footnote\u0022\u003earound 0.65% APY currently\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eMinimum Balance – Money market accounts require heftier deposits to start earning interest.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003ePerks – Combine savings account cash availability with investment account-esque interest.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nWith easy access plus slightly amplified rates compared to basic savings, good fits include:\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eParking cash for frequent or upcoming expenses like medical bills.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eMaintaining your emergency fund for quick access when needed.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nDownside? Minimum balance requirements limit money market accounts’ utility for smaller savers.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ch2\u003eCertificate of deposit (cd) accounts\u003c/h2\u003e\r\nCD accounts take a different approach by rewarding savers who commit to locking up funds for a set period. In exchange, they offer notably higher interest rates than other savings vehicles.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eInterest Rate/APY – Commonly \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/national-rates/index.html#footnote\u0022\u003e22% to 1.79% APY based on CD term length\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eLimitations – Early withdrawal results in financial penalties, negating interest upside.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003ePerks – Top interest rates on short-term savings products.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nCDs incentivize long-term commitments, making them advantageous when:\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eSaving for known future expenses like a down payment due in twelve months.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eBuilding funds for a large purchase like a wedding or dream vacation.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eEarning higher returns on extra cash not needed for daily expenses.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nBefore opening a CD, determine when you’ll need access to the funds. Optimal uses line up with its maturity/term length.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nPro Tip: Take advantage of “CD laddering” by opening multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates. This provides access to some funds each year while ensuring you always have one CD earning the high, locked-in rates.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ch2\u003eSaving account limits to know\u003c/h2\u003e\r\nIt used to be that all deposit accounts had federal limits in place to protect financial institutions, but this is no longer the case. \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/regulation-d/\u0022\u003eThe Fed now allows for unlimited transfers and withdrawals from savings accounts\u003c/a\u003e, but individual financial institutions may still have limits in place.\r\n\r\nNext, \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/faq/#:~:text=The%20standard%20deposit%20insurance%20coverage,held%20at%20the%20same%20bank.\u0022\u003efederal insurance protects deposit account balances up to $250,000 per person, per bank\u003c/a\u003e.
