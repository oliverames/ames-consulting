It’s helpful for the person on the receiving end and it’s heartwarming for the person on the giving end. (Actually, it’s usually heartwarming for both.) You can volunteer for skilled jobs that allow you to put your expertise to good use, but there are a lot of unskilled volunteer positions that allow you to lend a helping hand and enjoy the volunteer experience without having to be an expert.\n\nVolunteer options abound in Vermont, but it can take some research to find something near you. The list below will help you get started in your search. If you’ve never volunteered before, I hope you’ll take the leap this holiday season and find out how addictive it can be to make a positive impact on your community.\n\u003ch2\u003eCentral vermont\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vtfoodbank.org/give-time/volunteer\u0022\u003eThe Vermont Foodbank\u003c/a\u003e\n\nEvery day, staff and volunteers at the Vermont Foodbank help feed our Vermont neighbors who cannot afford to put food on the table.
