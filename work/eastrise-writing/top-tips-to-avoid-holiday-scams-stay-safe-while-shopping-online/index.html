You might forget about monitoring your accounts or rush through an online purchase without thinking twice. Fraudsters take advantage of this and use several different techniques to implement their scams on unknowing individuals. Let’s go over some of the scams to watch out this season, as well as some tips on how you can prevent fraud affecting your finances:\r\n\r\n\u003cu\u003eSocial Media Scams\u003c/u\u003e: Fraudsters will set up fake online stores and use social media to advertise the fake websites.

Like social media scams, charity scams often try to replicate a charity website convincing you to donate money, which goes right to the criminal.\r\n\r\n\u003cu\u003eAirline Ticket Scams\u003c/u\u003e: Fraudsters know that travel needs increase around the holidays. To take advantage of that, the scammers will send emails or make fake advertisements about cheap airline tickets. Don’t be fooled by the too-good-to-be-true prices.\r\n\r\n\u003cu\u003eFraud Prevention Tips\u003c/u\u003e\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eSign up for alerts and notifications through your online banking portal to monitor your account for unauthorized transactions.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eDon’t provide your digital banking credentials to anyone- no legitimate company will ask you for your login or password.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eUse well-known websites for online purchases.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n \t\u003cli\u003eDon’t click on advertisements through social media or emails.
