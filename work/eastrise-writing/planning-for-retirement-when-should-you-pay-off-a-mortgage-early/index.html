Just the thought of going into retirement with no or minimal debts gets me excited. Is paying off your mortgage before you retire right for everyone? The short answer is no. Here is why.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003ch2\u003eWhen to pay off your mortgage early\u003c/h2\u003e\nIf you’re trying to live off limited or no income—as most heading into retirement hope to—paying off your mortgage early can take a big chunk out of your monthly expenses. Not to mention the mental lift that you get not having to worry about that expense!\n\nYou might also want to pay off your mortgage early to save on interest payments and servicing fees. While you won’t be able to deduct the interest on your taxes anymore, you’ll likely still save money. You might not want to do this if it would cut into retirement funds that may continue to appreciate over time. Note that if you withdraw funds from your 401(k) before age 59.5 to pay off your mortgage, you’ll end up paying a \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/021015/how-much-are-taxes-ira-withdrawal.asp\u0022\u003e10% penalty\u003c/a\u003e on top of your standard income tax. It’s unlikely that the savings from getting rid of your mortgage will be greater than the penalty you pay for withdrawing funds early.\n\nIf your mortgage rate is higher than that of risk-free returns, paying off your mortgage can be as impactful as earning a risk-free return the equivalent of your interest rate. For example, if you are currently paying an interest rate of 5%, paying off your mortgage (and saving on interest) is like getting  tax-free 5% return! Like with most things in personal finance, it is all about finding a balance between the cost of a loan and the returns you might get with your funds stored elsewhere.\n\nIt may also make sense to pay off your mortgage if you do not have any high-interest debt, such as credit card debt. Since it is usually a good idea to \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/good-vs-bad-debt-whats-the-difference-when-managing-debt/\u0022\u003efocus on paying off your high-interest debt\u003c/a\u003e while still making payments on your low-interest debt, paying off your mortgage before your high-interest debt is typically a bad idea.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003ch2\u003eWhen not to pay off your mortgage early\u003c/h2\u003e\nIf you are behind in your retirement savings, saving in your retirement accounts should likely be your top priority. For example, funds that grow in your 401(k) aren’t taxed until you withdraw the money. If you aren’t sure if you are behind on your savings, find a local financial advisor to help you make a retirement plan.\n\nHow much liquid cash do you have saved outside of your investments and home? If it’s not much, it might not be the best idea to pay off your mortgage and become “house rich and cash poor.” It is always a good idea to have an emergency fund with enough cash available to cover the next three to six months of expenses. When in retirement, it’s usually a good idea to have even more than that set aside in cash. How much depends on your retirement income and any risk with your retirement funds. Plus, if you pay off your mortgage early and down the road find you need the money, it may be harder to \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/should-i-get-a-home-equity-loan-or-line-of-credit/\u0022\u003etap into the equity of your home\u003c/a\u003e later.\n\nHaving a diverse set of investments and assets is a good idea, so if paying off your mortgage puts most of your money into your house, it may not be the right thing for you. Speaking with a financial advisor can help you figure out if you’re too deep into one asset type or another.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\nDeciding if you should pay off your mortgage early is a decision filled with variables unique to you. If you aren’t quite sure if you’re ready to do it yet, see if you can responsibly do two to three \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-to-reduce-debt-faster-with-principal-payments/\u0022\u003eextra principal payments\u003c/a\u003e every year. These payments can chip away at the sum, saving you money long-term.","_long-form_text_0_tm_content":"field_6261e075a1fd3","long-form_text_0_link":"","_long-form_text_0_link":"field_5cf03b9fd9763","long-form_text_0_ada_toggle":"0","_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle":"field_5cf03bdad9764","long-form_text_0_optional_button":"","_long-form_text_0_optional_button":"field_638fb38cc1e4d","long-form_text":1,"_long-form_text":"field_6261dfe4a1fcf","row_alignment":"justify-center","_row_alignment":"field_610af955b60a5","row_background_color":"white","_row_background_color":"field_5e2f5d26eaae3","horizontal_rule":"0","_horizontal_rule":"field_5989fb5734d75","content_block_anchor":"","_content_block_anchor":"field_5984d175eaf00","block_settings":"","_block_settings":"field_62aa0ef7c0352"},"mode":"edit","id":"acf-block-66b2646178322"} /-->
