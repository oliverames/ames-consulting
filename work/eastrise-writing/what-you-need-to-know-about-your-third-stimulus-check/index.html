It now heads to President Biden’s desk, where it is expected to be signed into law as early as this week. Among a variety of economic recovery initiatives, the bill includes direct payments to Americans. Here is what you need to know!\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003ch2\u003eHow much will i receive?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/06/business/stimulus-check-plan-details\u0022\u003eThe New York Times reports\u003c/a\u003e that individual filers will receive $1,400 if they make $75,000 or less. Couples filing jointly will receive twice that if they make $150,000 or less. Those filing as heads of household will receive their full payment if they make $112,500 or less.\n\nThe maximum income threshold to receive a stimulus payment has changed this time around. Now individual filers who make $80,000 or more won’t receive a stimulus payment. The same applies to joint filers making $160,000 or more and heads of household making $120,000.\n\nPayment amounts are based on the latest tax return available to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If you have already filed your 2020 return, they’ll use it to calculate your payment. If you have not filed your 2020 return, they’ll use your 2019 return to determine how much you’ll receive.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003cdiv class=\u0022section post\u002d\u002dsingle-body\u0022\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow do i track my payment?\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe mechanics of this round of stimulus payments are expected to be similar to previous payments, \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-are-the-stimulus-checks-coming-and-who-will-get-one-11615216538\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 rel=\u0022noopener\u0022\u003eaccording to \u003cem\u003eThe Wall Street Journal\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. The United States Treasury will likely direct the IRS to issue funds either through a check, debit card, or direct deposit. Although it is not possible to update direct deposit information specific to this round of stimulus payments, you can change your information by filing your 2020 taxes. \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment-frequently-asked-questions#collapseCollapsible1613060365796\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 rel=\u0022noopener\u0022\u003eThe IRS will use whatever account is on your most recent tax return.\u003c/a\u003e\n\nStay tuned to \u003ca href=\u0022http://irs.gov/EIP\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 rel=\u0022noopener\u0022\u003eIRS.GOV/EIP\u003c/a\u003e for more information over the coming weeks!\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003cdiv class=\u0022section post\u002d\u002dsingle-body\u0022\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat about dependents?\u003c/h2\u003e\nFilers will receive a full $1,400 per dependent.

(The previous round of stimulus payments for dependents topped out at 17 years old.) If you claim either of these groups as dependents on your taxes, you’ll receive a stimulus payment for them. \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-are-the-stimulus-checks-coming-and-who-will-get-one-11615216538\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 rel=\u0022noopener\u0022\u003eBabies born in 2021 are eligible for this payment\u003c/a\u003e and filers will receive $1,400 per child when they file their 2021 tax return next year.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is the child tax credit?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/06/business/stimulus-check-plan-details#how-would-the-bill-change-the-child-tax-credit\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 rel=\u0022noopener\u0022\u003eThe child tax credit will also change\u003c/a\u003e with the passage of the American Rescue Plan. Families with eligible children in 2021 can claim a credit of $3,600 per child if they are five and under or $3,000 per child between the ages of six and seventeen. The benefits of this change won’t come into full effect until Americans begin filing their 2021 taxes in 2022.\n\nHowever, the bill does allow filers to receive an advance on their 2021 tax credit. Starting in July, you can get half of the overall tax credit you would receive. While it is unclear at this time how that payment will be delivered, it appears that funds would be \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/10/child-tax-credit-what-you-need-to-know/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 rel=\u0022noopener\u0022\u003esent via direct deposit on a periodic basis\u003c/a\u003e throughout the remainder of the year.

It was slated to expire on March 14. Although the payment amounts were not increased to $400 per month, the bill includes a bigger tax benefit for households making under $150,000 a year. \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/stimulus-bill-unemployment-benefits-this-new-tax-break-could-save-you-money/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 rel=\u0022noopener\u0022\u003eNow up to $10,200 of unemployment payments in 2020 are tax exempt.\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat else is in the bill?\u003c/h2\u003e\nIn addition to direct payments, the bill includes \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/05/stimulus-explainer-basics-checks-unemployment-taxes-spending/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 rel=\u0022noopener\u0022\u003e$350 billion for local governments and tens of billions of dollars to support COVID-19 vaccines and testing\u003c/a\u003e.
