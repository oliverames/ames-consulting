Those who filed their taxes in 2018 or 2019 do not have to do anything to receive their check. There are a lot of details to this stimulus package, so we've compiled everything you need to know, including when you can expect to receive your stimulus.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ch2\u003eFiling as an individual\u003c/h2\u003e\r\nIf you filed your taxes individually in either 2018 or 2019 and have an adjusted gross income (AGI) up to $75,000, you will receive $1,200. If your AGI is from $75,000 up to $99,000, the payment amount is reduced by $5 for every $100 above the $75,000 threshold. If you have kids, you will receive up to $500 for each qualifying child (dependent aged sixteen or younger). If you have no children and have an AGI that exceeds $99,000, you are not eligible to receive this stimulus.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ch2\u003eFiling jointly\u003c/h2\u003e\r\nIf you filed your taxes jointly in either 2018 or 2019 and your AGI is up to $150,000, you will receive $2,400. If your AGI is from $150,000 up to $198,000, your payment amount will be reduced by $5 for every $100 above the $150,000 threshold. If you have kids, you will receive up to $500 for each qualifying child (dependent aged sixteen or younger). If you have no children and have an AGI that exceeds $198,000 jointly, you are not eligible to receive this stimulus.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ch2\u003eHow will i get my payment?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\nIf you used direct deposit to get your tax refund in 2018 or 2019, the IRS will direct deposit your stimulus check into that account. If you did not use direct deposit in 2018 or 2019, the IRS is developing a portal at \u003ca href=\u0022http://irs.gov/coronavirus\u0022\u003eirs.gov/coronavirus\u003c/a\u003e, where you will be able to give them your bank information. If you did not use direct deposit for your 2018 or 2019 tax return and don't input your information, you will receive a check in the mail.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ch2\u003eWhen will i get my payment?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\nAccording to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, direct deposits will start on April 9.

Each person who falls into one of these brackets will receive $1,200. The IRS will use Form SSA-1099 or Form RRB-1099 to determine where to send your payment.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ch2\u003eWhere can i find more information?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\nThere is lots more information available on the\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know\u0022\u003e IRS Newsroom page\u003c/a\u003e or the \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus\u0022\u003eIRS Coronavirus page\u003c/a\u003e. These two resources are updated frequently with new information.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003ch2\u003eI’ve never used direct deposit, what do i need to know?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\nIf you’ve never used direct deposit before, you’ll need to check \u003ca href=\u0022http://irs.gov/coronavirus\u0022\u003ethis page\u003c/a\u003e in a few days to find the direct deposit form the IRS will be launching. Then you’ll need to know some information about your credit union or bank account, specifically the routing and account numbers associated with the account you’d like to receive the deposit in.\r\n\r\nThe routing number for your financial institution can be found at the bottom of your check (as shown below within the red circle). If you don’t have checks, you will likely find it on the institution’s website homepage. Domestic banks and credit unions do not have IBAN or SWIFT codes/numbers. (Note: VSECU's routing and transit number is 211691127, which you can also find at the top right-hand corner of this website page). Your account numbers is the string of numbers to the right of the routing number (to the right of the red circle).\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u003cimg class=\u0022aligncenter\u0022 src=\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/VSECU%20check.jpg?width=370\u0026amp;name=VSECU%20check.jpg\u0022 sizes=\u0022(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\u0022 srcset=\u0022https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/VSECU%20check.jpg?width=185\u0026amp;name=VSECU%20check.jpg 185w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/VSECU%20check.jpg?width=370\u0026amp;name=VSECU%20check.jpg 370w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/VSECU%20check.jpg?width=555\u0026amp;name=VSECU%20check.jpg 555w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/VSECU%20check.jpg?width=740\u0026amp;name=VSECU%20check.jpg 740w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/VSECU%20check.jpg?width=925\u0026amp;name=VSECU%20check.jpg 925w, https://blog.vsecu.com/hs-fs/hubfs/VSECU%20check.jpg?width=1110\u0026amp;name=VSECU%20check.jpg 1110w\u0022 alt=\u0022VSECU check\u0022 width=\u0022370\u0022 /\u003e\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eMEMBERS:\u003c/strong\u003e If you want to find your account numbers in Online Banking, go to www.vsecu.com and login to Online Banking in the upper right-hand corner.
