Many people focus on their finances, and setting financial goals can be a great way to improve your financial health and build a solid foundation for your future.\u003c!\u002d\u002dmore\u002d\u002d\u003e\n\nThis year, rather than making resolutions, I suggest making new year’s “intentions!” New year’s intentions are a positive and proactive way to approach goal setting and self-improvement. Unlike resolutions, which tend to be negative and focus on what you should stop doing or avoid, intentions are positive and focus on what you want to do or achieve. By setting intentions, you are taking control of your life and setting the stage for a successful and fulfilling year.\n\nAdditionally, intentions are more flexible and forgiving than resolutions, which can be strict and easy to break. This means you are more likely to stick to your intentions and achieve your goals. As a result, setting intentions is a more effective and sustainable way to make positive changes in your life.\n\nHere are some financial intentions to consider as you plan for the new year!\n\u003ch2\u003eCreate a budget\u003c/h2\u003e\nOne of the most important things you can do to improve your financial health is to \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-to-make-a-budget/\u0022\u003ecreate a budget\u003c/a\u003e. A budget can help you track your spending and make sure you’re not overspending in any one area. Creating a budget may seem daunting, but many resources are available to help you get started. Writers on this blog have provided \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/category/saving-and-budgeting/\u0022\u003emany helpful tips when it comes to budgeting!\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSave for emergencies\u003c/h2\u003e\nNo one likes to think about unexpected expenses, but they can happen to anyone at any time. Just the other day, my dryer broke! An emergency fund can help you avoid debt if you face a sudden expense, such as a car repair or medical bill. Try to save at least three to six months’ worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. Knowing you’ve got a nice lump of money set aside is a huge stress reliever.\n\u003ch2\u003ePay off debt and refinance your loans\u003c/h2\u003e\nIf you’re carrying high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, it’s essential to pay them off as quickly as possible. Consider setting up a \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-to-calculate-your-debt-payoff/\u0022\u003edebt repayment plan\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt-fast/\u0022\u003emaking regular payments to reduce your balances\u003c/a\u003e and save on interest charges. If you have high-interest loans, consider refinancing them in the new year to save money on interest.\n\u003ch2\u003eInvest in your future\u003c/h2\u003e\nWhether \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/mr-money-mustaches-cost-cutting-tips-to-save-money-and-retire-early/\u0022\u003esaving for retirement\u003c/a\u003e, a \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/can-you-afford-to-buy-a-new-home/\u0022\u003edown payment on a home\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/the-best-way-to-save-for-a-childs-future/\u0022\u003eyour child’s education\u003c/a\u003e, investing in your future can help you build wealth and achieve your financial goals. Consider talking to a financial advisor to help determine the best investment strategies for your situation.\n\u003ch2\u003eImprove your credit score\u003c/h2\u003e\nYour credit score can impact many aspects of your financial life, from the interest rates you’re offered on loans to your ability to rent an apartment or get a job. If you have a low credit score, \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-to-fix-your-credit-score-little-by-little/\u0022\u003eimprove it\u003c/a\u003e by paying your bills on time, reducing your balances, and not applying for new credit unnecessarily.\n\u003ch2\u003eProtect your assets \u003c/h2\u003e\nProtect the things you’ve worked hard to accumulate, such as your home, car, and other valuable possessions. Consider purchasing insurance to protect against unexpected events like fire or natural disasters.\n\nIf you already have insurance, ensure you have the right coverage to protect yourself and your loved ones. This can include health insurance, life insurance, homeowner’s or renter’s insurance, and even \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/four-things-to-consider-to-choose-the-best-pet-insurance/\u0022\u003epet insurance\u003c/a\u003e. Review your current policies and make any necessary changes in the new year!\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u003ch2\u003eCurb impulse purchases\u003c/h2\u003e\nImpulse purchases can add up quickly and derail your budget and financial goals. Make a new year’s intention to reduce possible impulse purchases by thinking before you buy and setting a budget for discretionary spending.\n\nSpeaking of impulse purchases, it’s easy to lose track of where your money is going, but being more mindful of your spending can help you save money and reach your financial goals. Try tracking your expenses for a month to see where you can cut back!\n\u003ch2\u003ePlan for retirement\u003c/h2\u003e\nIf you haven’t already done so, it’s important to start \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/retirement-planning-checklist/\u0022\u003eplanning for retirement\u003c/a\u003e as soon as possible. This may involve setting up a retirement savings account, such as a 401(k) or IRA, and making regular contributions. If your employer offers a match to what you contribute, that’s essentially free money! Consider talking to a financial advisor to help determine the best retirement savings plan for your situation.\n\u003ch2\u003eEducate yourself\u003c/h2\u003e\nOne of the keys to improving your financial health is to educate yourself about money and how it works. Consider \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/four-of-the-best-finance-books-to-read-for-financial-literacy-month/\u0022\u003ereading books\u003c/a\u003e, attending workshops, \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/five-of-the-best-financial-podcasts-to-help-you-learn-about-finance/\u0022\u003elistening to podcasts\u003c/a\u003e, or talking to financial professionals to learn more about investing, saving, and budgeting. \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/what-is-financial-literacy-and-why-is-it-important/\u0022\u003eThe more financially literate you are, the more comfortable you’ll be making financial decisions\u003c/a\u003e that will impact your future. Given that you’re reading this blog, you’ve already taken a significant step toward ensuring a secure financial future!\n\u003ch2\u003eSeek financial advice\u003c/h2\u003e\nFinancial advice can be invaluable for achieving your financial goals, as it can provide guidance and support to help you make intelligent financial decisions. Make it a goal in the new year to seek financial advice, whether it’s from a financial planner, a financial coach, or a trusted friend or family member.\n\u003ch2\u003eStart a side hustle\u003c/h2\u003e\nIf you’re looking for ways to earn extra money, \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.vsecu.com/blog/how-to-start-a-side-hustle-and-make-extra-money/\u0022\u003econsider starting a side hustle\u003c/a\u003e in the new year. Whether freelancing, selling products online, or doing odd jobs for neighbors and friends, a side hustle can help you bring in extra income. Plus, sometimes a side hustle can lead to a rewarding new career path!\n\u003ch2\u003eGet your financial documents in order\u003c/h2\u003e\nMake it a goal to get your financial documents in order in the new year. This can include organizing your bills (I keep the past few months’ worth), updating your will, and making sure you have copies of essential documents like your birth certificate and Social Security card should you need to prove your identity. I like to keep my important documents in a safe and secure location and audit them regularly. A fireproof lock box is a great place!\n\u003ch2\u003eBe kind to yourself\u003c/h2\u003e\nLastly, being kind to yourself is vital as you work towards your financial goals. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you make mistakes or don’t achieve your goals immediately. If you beat yourself up over it, you're unlikely to stick to your goals over the long term. Remember that improving your financial health is a journey that takes time.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\nMaking financial intentions is a great way to kick off the new year and start working towards your financial goals. By setting realistic goals, creating a plan, and seeking advice, you can take control of your finances and set yourself up for a successful and financially secure year.\n\n\u0026nbsp;","_long-form_text_0_tm_content":"field_6261e075a1fd3","long-form_text_0_link":"","_long-form_text_0_link":"field_5cf03b9fd9763","long-form_text_0_ada_toggle":"0","_long-form_text_0_ada_toggle":"field_5cf03bdad9764","long-form_text_0_optional_button":"","_long-form_text_0_optional_button":"field_638fb38cc1e4d","long-form_text":1,"_long-form_text":"field_6261dfe4a1fcf","row_alignment":"justify-center","_row_alignment":"field_610af955b60a5","row_background_color":"white","_row_background_color":"field_5e2f5d26eaae3","horizontal_rule":"0","_horizontal_rule":"field_5989fb5734d75","content_block_anchor":"","_content_block_anchor":"field_5984d175eaf00","block_settings":"","_block_settings":"field_62aa0ef7c0352"},"mode":"edit","id":"acf-block-66b2646178322"} /-->
